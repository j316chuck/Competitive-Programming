In fairy-tales, witches always wear silly black hats and black cloaks, and they ride on broomsticks.  But this is not a fairy-tale. This is about Real Witches.  The most important thing you should know about Real Witches is this.  Listen very carefully.  Never forget what is coming next.  Real Witches dress in ordinary clothes and look very much like ordinary women. They live in ordinary houses and work in Ordinary Jobs.  That is why they are so hard to catch.  A Real Witch hates children with a red-hot sizzling hatred that is more sizzling and red-hot than any hatred you could possibly imagine.

Round about the caldron go; In the poison'd entrails throw.  Toad, that under cold stone, Days and nights has thirty-one; Swelter'd venom sleeping got, Boil thou first i' the charmed pot!  Double, double toil and trouble; Fire burn, and cauldron bubble.  Fillet of a fenny snake, In the caldron boil and bake; Eye of newt, and toe of frog, Wool of bat, and tongue of dog; Adder's fork, and blind-worm's sting, Lizard's leg, and howlet's wing; For a charm of pow'rful trouble, Like a hell-broth boil and bubble.  Double, double toil and trouble; Fire burn, and cauldron bubble.  Scale of dragon, tooth of wolf, Witches' mummy, maw and gulf Of the ravin'd salt-sea shark; Root of hemlock digg'd i' the dark.
