Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity, He's broken every  human law, he breaks the law of gravity.  His powers of levitation  would make a fakir stare, And when you reach the scene of crime -  Macavity's not there!  You may seek him in the basement, you may look  up in the air - But I tell you once and once again, Macavity's not there!  Macavity's a ginger cat, he's very tall and thin; You would know him if you saw him, for his eyes are sunken in.  His brow is deeply lined with thought, his head is highly domed; His coat is dusty from neglect, his whiskers are uncombed.  He sways his head from side to side, with movements like a snake; And when you think he's half asleep, he's always wide awake.

`Please would you tell me,' said Alice, a little timidly, for she was not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first, `why your cat grins like that?' `It's a Cheshire cat,' said the Duchess, `and that's why. Pig!'  She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite jumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the baby, and not to her, so she took courage, and went on again:  `I didn't know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I didn't know that cats could grin.'  `They all can,' said the Duchess; `and most of 'em do.'  `I don't know of any that do,' Alice said very politely, feeling quite pleased to have got into a conversation.
