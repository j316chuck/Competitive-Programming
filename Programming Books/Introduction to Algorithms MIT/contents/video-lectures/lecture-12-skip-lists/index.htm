<p><span m="7000">Good morning. Today we're going to talk about</span> <span m="10000">it a balanced search structure, so a data structure that</span> <span m="14000">maintains a dynamic set subject to insertion,</span> <span m="18000">deletion, and search called skip lists.</span> </p>
<p><span m="21000">So, I'll call this a dynamic search structure because it's a</span> <span m="25000">data structure. It supports search,</span> <span m="28000">and it's dynamic, meaning insert and delete.</span> </p>
<p><span m="33000">So, what other dynamic search structures do we know,</span> </p>
<p><span m="39000">just for sake of comparison, and to wake everyone up?</span> </p>
<p><span m="45000">Shut them out, efficient, I should say,</span> </p>
<p><span m="50000">also good, logarithmic time per operation.</span> </p>
<p><span m="55000">So, this is a really easy question to get us off the</span> <span m="61000">ground. You've seen them all in the</span> <span m="65000">last week, so it shouldn't be so hard.</span> </p>
<p><span m="68000">Treap, good. On the problems that we saw</span> <span m="71000">treaps. That's, in some sense,</span> <span m="73000">the simplest dynamic search structure you can get from first</span> <span m="77000">principles because all we needed was a bound on a randomly</span> <span m="81000">constructed binary search tree. And then treaps did well.</span> </p>
<p><span m="86000">So, that was sort of the first one you saw depending on when</span> <span m="90000">you did your problem set. What else?</span> </p>
<p><span m="94000">Charles? Red black trees,</span> <span m="96000">good answer. So, that was exactly one week</span> <span m="100000">ago. I hope you still remember it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="104000">They have guaranteed log n performance.</span> </p>
<p><span m="108000">So, this was an expected bound. This was a worst-case order log</span> <span m="115000">n per operation, insert, delete,</span> <span m="118000">and search. And, there was one more for</span> <span m="122000">those who want to recitation on Friday: B trees,</span> <span m="127000">good. And, by B trees,</span> <span m="130000">I also include two-three trees, two-three-four trees,</span> <span m="134000">and all those guys. So, if B is a constant,</span> <span m="136000">or if you want your B trees knows a little bit cleverly,</span> <span m="139000">that these have guaranteed order log n performance,</span> <span m="142000">so, worst case, order log n.</span> </p>
<p><span m="144000">So, you should know this. These are all balanced search</span> <span m="147000">structures. They are dynamic.</span> </p>
<p><span m="149000">They support insertions and deletions.</span> </p>
<p><span m="151000">They support searches, finding a given key.</span> </p>
<p><span m="154000">And if you don't find the key, you find its predecessor and</span> <span m="157000">successor pretty easily in all of these structures.</span> </p>
<p><span m="162000">If you want to augment some data structure,</span> <span m="164000">you should think about which one of these is easiest to</span> <span m="168000">augment, as in Monday's lecture. So, the question I want to pose</span> <span m="173000">to you is supposed I gave you all a laptop right now,</span> <span m="176000">which would be great. Then I asked you,</span> <span m="179000">in order to keep this laptop you have to implement one of</span> <span m="183000">these data structures, let's say, within this class</span> <span m="186000">hour. Do you think you could do it?</span> </p>
<p><span m="189000">How many people think you could do it?</span> </p>
<p><span m="192000">A couple people, a few people,</span> <span m="193000">OK, all front row people, good.</span> </p>
<p><span m="195000">I could probably do it. My preference would be B trees.</span> </p>
<p><span m="199000">They're sort of the simplest in my mind.</span> </p>
<p><span m="201000">This is without using the textbook.</span> </p>
<p><span m="203000">This would be a closed book exam.</span> </p>
<p><span m="205000">I don't have enough laptops to do it, unfortunately.</span> </p>
<p><span m="210000">So, B trees are pretty reasonable.</span> </p>
<p><span m="212000">Deletion, you have to remember stealing from a sibling and</span> <span m="215000">whatnot. So, deletions are a bit tricky.</span> </p>
<p><span m="217000">Red black trees, I can never remember it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="220000">I'd have to look it up, or re-derive the three cases.</span> </p>
<p><span m="223000">treaps are a bit fancy. So, that would take a little</span> <span m="226000">while to remember exactly how those work.</span> </p>
<p><span m="229000">You'd have to solve your problem set again,</span> <span m="231000">if you don't have it memorized. Skip lists, on the other hand,</span> <span m="235000">are a data structure you will never forget,</span> <span m="237000">and something you can implement within an hour,</span> <span m="240000">no problem. I've made this claim a couple</span> <span m="243000">times before, and I always felt bad because I</span> <span m="245000">had never actually done it. So, this morning,</span> <span m="250000">I implemented skip lists, and it took me ten minutes to</span> <span m="253000">implement a linked list, and 30 minutes to implement</span> <span m="257000">skip lists. And another 30 minutes</span> <span m="259000">debugging them. There you go.</span> </p>
<p><span m="261000">It can be done. Skip lists are really simple.</span> </p>
<p><span m="264000">And, at no point writing the code did I have to think,</span> <span m="267000">whereas every other structure I would have to think.</span> </p>
<p><span m="272000">There was one moment when I thought, ah, how do I flip a</span> <span m="276000">coin? That was the entire amount of</span> <span m="278000">thinking. So, skip lists are a randomized</span> <span m="281000">structure. Let's add in another adjective</span> <span m="284000">here, and let's also add in simple.</span> </p>
<p><span m="286000">So, we have a simple, efficient, dynamic,</span> <span m="289000">randomized search structure: all those things together.</span> </p>
<p><span m="293000">So, it's sort of like treaps and that the bound is only a</span> <span m="297000">randomized bound. But today, we're going to see a</span> <span m="301000">much stronger bound than an expectation bound.</span> </p>
<p><span m="306000">So, in particular, skip lists will run in order</span> <span m="311000">log n expected time. So, the running time for each</span> <span m="317000">operation will be order log n in expectation.</span> </p>
<p><span m="322000">But, we're going to prove a much stronger result that their</span> <span m="328000">order log n, with high probability.</span> </p>
<p><span m="334000">So, this is a very strong claim.</span> </p>
<p><span m="337000">And it means that the running time of each operation,</span> <span m="342000">the running time of every operation is order log n almost</span> <span m="348000">always in a certain sense. Why don't I foreshadow that?</span> </p>
<p><span m="354000">So, it's something like, the probability that it's order</span> <span m="359000">log n is at least one minus one over some polynomial,</span> <span m="365000">and n. And, you get to set the</span> <span m="368000">polynomial however large you like.</span> </p>
<p><span m="370000">So, what this basically means is that almost all the time,</span> <span m="373000">you take your skip lists, you do a polynomial number of</span> <span m="376000">operations on it, because presumably you are</span> <span m="378000">running a polynomial time algorithm that using this data</span> <span m="381000">structure. Do polynomial numbers of</span> <span m="383000">inserts, delete searches, every single one of them will</span> <span m="386000">take order log n time, almost guaranteed.</span> </p>
<p><span m="390000">So this is a really strong bound on the tail of the</span> <span m="393000">distribution. The mean is order log n.</span> </p>
<p><span m="396000">That's not so exciting. But, in fact,</span> <span m="399000">almost all of the weight of this probability distribution is</span> <span m="403000">right around the log n, just tiny little epsilons,</span> <span m="407000">very tiny probabilities you could be bigger than log n.</span> </p>
<p><span m="411000">So that's where we are going. This is a data structure by</span> <span m="415000">Pugh] in 1989. This is the most recent.</span> </p>
<p><span m="420000">Actually, no, sorry, treaps are more recent.</span> </p>
<p><span m="423000">They were like '93 or so, but a fairly recent data</span> <span m="426000">structure for just insert, delete, search.</span> </p>
<p><span m="429000">And, it's very simple. You can derive it if you don't</span> <span m="433000">know anything about data structures, well,</span> <span m="436000">almost nothing. Now, analyzing that the</span> <span m="439000">performance is log n, that, of course,</span> <span m="441000">takes our sophistication. But the data structure itself</span> <span m="445000">is very simple. We're going to start from</span> <span m="450000">scratch. Suppose you don't know what a</span> <span m="454000">red black tree is. You don't know what a B tree</span> <span m="458000">is. Suppose you don't even know</span> <span m="461000">what a tree is. What is the simplest data</span> <span m="465000">structure for storing a bunch of items for storing a dynamic set?</span> </p>
<p><span m="471000">A list, good, a linked list.</span> </p>
<p><span m="474000">Now, suppose that it's a sorted linked list.</span> </p>
<p><span m="478000">So, I'm going to be a little bit fancier there.</span> </p>
<p><span m="485000">So, if you have a linked list of items, here it is,</span> <span m="490000">maybe we'll make it doubly linked just for kicks,</span> <span m="496000">how long does it take to search in a sorted linked list?</span> </p>
<p><span m="502000">Log n is one answer. n is the other answer.</span> </p>
<p><span m="506000">Which one is right? n is the right answer.</span> </p>
<p><span m="511000">So, even though it's sorted, we can't do binary search</span> <span m="515000">because we don't have random-access into a linked</span> <span m="518000">list. So, suppose I'm only given a</span> <span m="520000">pointer to the head. Otherwise, I'm assuming it's an</span> <span m="524000">array. So, in a sorted array you can</span> <span m="526000">search in log n. Sorted linked list:</span> <span m="528000">you've still got to scan through the darn thing.</span> </p>
<p><span m="531000">So, theta n, worst case search.</span> </p>
<p><span m="533000">Not so good, but if we just try to improve</span> <span m="536000">it a little bit, we will discover skip lists</span> <span m="539000">automatically. So, this is our starting point:</span> <span m="543000">sorted linked lists, data n time.</span> </p>
<p><span m="546000">And, I'm not going to think too much about insertions and</span> <span m="549000">deletions for the moment. Let's just get search better,</span> <span m="552000">and then we'll worry about dates.</span> </p>
<p><span m="555000">Updates are where randomization will come in.</span> </p>
<p><span m="557000">Search: pretty easy idea. So, how can we make a linked</span> <span m="561000">list better? Suppose all we know about our</span> <span m="563000">linked lists. What can I do to make it</span> <span m="566000">faster? This is where you need a little</span> <span m="568000">bit of innovation, some creativity.</span> </p>
<p><span m="572000">More links: that's a good idea. So, I do try to maybe add</span> <span m="577000">pointers to go a couple steps ahead.</span> </p>
<p><span m="580000">If I had log n pointers, I could do all powers of two</span> <span m="585000">ahead. That's a pretty good search</span> <span m="588000">structure. Some people use that;</span> <span m="591000">like, some peer-to-peer networks use that idea.</span> </p>
<p><span m="596000">But that's a little too fancy for me.</span> </p>
<p><span m="601000">Ah, good. You could try to build a tree</span> <span m="603000">on this linear structure. That's essentially where we're</span> <span m="607000">going. So, you could try to put</span> <span m="609000">pointers to, like, the middle of the list from the</span> <span m="612000">roots. So, you search between either</span> <span m="614000">here. You point to the median,</span> <span m="616000">so you can compare against the median, and know whether you</span> <span m="620000">should go in the first half or the second half that's</span> <span m="623000">definitely on the right track, also a bit too sophisticated.</span> </p>
<p><span m="627000">Another list: yes.</span> </p>
<p><span m="629000">Yes, good. So, we are going to use two</span> <span m="632000">lists. That's sort of the next</span> <span m="634000">simplest thing you could do. OK, and as you suggested,</span> <span m="638000">we could maybe have pointers between them.</span> </p>
<p><span m="641000">So, maybe we have some elements down here, some of the elements</span> <span m="646000">up here. We want to have pointers</span> <span m="648000">between the lists. OK, it gets a little bit crazy</span> <span m="651000">in how exactly you might do that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="654000">But somehow, this feels good.</span> </p>
<p><span m="656000">So this is one linked list: L_1.</span> </p>
<p><span m="658000">This is another linked list: L_2.</span> </p>
<p><span m="662000">And, to give you some inspiration, I want to give you,</span> <span m="672000">so let's play a game. The game is,</span> <span m="679000">what is this sequence? So, the sequence is 14.</span> </p>
<p><span m="689000">If you know the answer, shout it out.</span> </p>
<p><span m="698000">Anyone yet? OK, it's tricky.</span> </p>
<p><span m="714000">It's a bit of a small class, so I hope someone knows the</span> <span m="718000">answer.</span> </p>
<p><span m="730000">How many TA's know the answer? Just a couple,</span> <span m="734000">OK, if you're looking at the slides, probably you know the</span> <span m="739000">answer. That's cheating.</span> </p>
<p><span m="741000">OK, I'll give you a hint. It is not a mathematical</span> <span m="746000">sequence. This is a real-life sequence.</span> </p>
<p><span m="749000">Yeah? Yeah, and what city?</span> </p>
<p><span m="752000">New York, yeah, this is the 7th Ave line.</span> </p>
<p><span m="756000">This is my favorite subway line in New York.</span> </p>
<p><span m="760000">But, what's a cool feature of the New York City subway?</span> </p>
<p><span m="766000">OK, it's a skip list. Good answer.</span> </p>
<p><span m="769000">[LAUGHTER] Indeed it is. Skip lists are so practical.</span> </p>
<p><span m="774000">They've been implemented in the subway system.</span> </p>
<p><span m="780000">How cool is that? OK, Boston subway is pretty</span> <span m="783000">cool because it's the oldest subway definitely in the United</span> <span m="788000">States, maybe in the world. New York is close,</span> <span m="791000">and it has other nice features like it's open 24 hours.</span> </p>
<p><span m="796000">That's a definite plus, but it also has this feature of</span> <span m="800000">express lines. So, it's a bit of an</span> <span m="803000">abstraction, but the 7th Ave line has</span> <span m="806000">essentially two kinds of cars. These are street numbers by the</span> <span m="809000">way. This is, Penn Station,</span> <span m="811000">Times Square, and so on.</span> </p>
<p><span m="813000">So, there are essentially two lines.</span> </p>
<p><span m="816000">There's the express line which goes 14, to 34,</span> <span m="819000">to 42, to 72, to 96.</span> </p>
<p><span m="821000">And then, there's the local line which stops at every stop.</span> </p>
<p><span m="825000">And, they accomplish this with four sets of tracks.</span> </p>
<p><span m="829000">So, I mean, the express lines have their own dedicated track.</span> </p>
<p><span m="834000">If you want to go to stop 59 from, let's say,</span> <span m="837000">Penn Station, well, let's say from lower west</span> <span m="840000">side, you get on the express line.</span> </p>
<p><span m="845000">You jump to 42 pretty quickly, and then you switch over to the</span> <span m="850000">local line, and go on to 59 or wherever I said I was going.</span> </p>
<p><span m="856000">OK, so this is express and local lines, and we can</span> <span m="861000">represent that with a couple of lists.</span> </p>
<p><span m="865000">We have one list, sure, we have one list on the</span> <span m="869000">bottom, so leave some space up here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="874000">This is the local line, L_2, 34, 42,</span> <span m="888000">50, 59, 66, 72, 79, and so on.</span> </p>
<p><span m="902000">And then we had the express line on top, which only stops at</span> <span m="908000">14, 34, 42, 72, and so on.</span> </p>
<p><span m="911000">I'm not going to redraw the whole list.</span> </p>
<p><span m="916000">You get the idea. And so, what we're going to do</span> <span m="921000">is put links between in the local and express lines,</span> <span m="927000">wherever they happen to meet. And, that's our two linked list</span> <span m="934000">structure. So, that's what I actually</span> <span m="938000">meant what I was trying to draw some picture.</span> </p>
<p><span m="942000">Now, this has a property that in one list, the bottom list,</span> <span m="947000">every element occurs. And the top list just copies</span> <span m="952000">some of those elements. And we're going to preserve</span> <span m="956000">that property. So, L_2 stores all the</span> <span m="960000">elements, and L_1 stores some subset.</span> </p>
<p><span m="965000">And, it's still open which ones we should store.</span> </p>
<p><span m="970000">That's the one thing we need to think about.</span> </p>
<p><span m="976000">But, our inspiration is from the New York subway system.</span> </p>
<p><span m="983000">OK, there, that the idea. Of course, we're also going to</span> <span m="990000">use more than two lists. OK, we also have links.</span> </p>
<p><span m="996000">Let's say it links between equal keys in L_1 and L_2.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1004000">Good. So, just for the sake of</span> <span m="1006000">completeness, and because we will need this</span> <span m="1010000">later, let's talk about searches before we worry about how these</span> <span m="1015000">lists are actually constructed. Of course, if I wanted that</span> <span m="1020000">board. So, if you want to search for</span> <span m="1024000">an element, x, what do you do?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1026000">Well, this is the taking the subway algorithm.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1029000">And, suppose you always start in the upper left corner of the</span> <span m="1034000">subway system, if you're always in the lower</span> <span m="1037000">west side, 14th St, and I don't know exactly where</span> <span m="1041000">that is, but more or less, somewhere down at the bottom of</span> <span m="1045000">Manhattan. And, you want to go to a</span> <span m="1047000">particular station like 59. Well, you'd stay on the express</span> <span m="1053000">line as long as you can because it happens that we started on</span> <span m="1057000">the express line. And then, you go down.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1059000">And then you take the local line the rest of the way.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1063000">That's clearly the right thing to do if you always start in the</span> <span m="1067000">top left corner. So, I'm going to write that</span> <span m="1070000">down in some kind of an algorithm because we will be</span> <span m="1074000">generalizing it. It's pretty obvious at this</span> <span m="1076000">point. It will remain obvious.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1080000">So, I want to walk right in the top list until that would go too</span> <span m="1086000">far. So, you imagine giving someone</span> <span m="1089000">directions on the subway system they've never been on.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1094000">So, you say, OK, you start at 14th.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1097000">Take the express line, and when you get to 72nd,</span> <span m="1102000">you've gone too far. Go back one,</span> <span m="1105000">and then go down to the local line.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1110000">It's really annoying directions.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1112000">But this is what an algorithm has to do because it's never</span> <span m="1117000">taken the subway before. So, it's going to check,</span> <span m="1121000">so let's do it here. So, suppose I'm aiming for 59.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1125000">So, I started 14, say the first thing I do is go</span> <span m="1129000">to 34. Then from there,</span> <span m="1131000">I go to 42. Still good because 59 is bigger</span> <span m="1134000">than 42. I go right again.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1136000">I say, oops, 72 is too big.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1139000">That was too far. So, I go back to where it just</span> <span m="1144000">was. Then I go down and then I keep</span> <span m="1147000">going right until I find the element that I want,</span> <span m="1152000">or discover that it's not in the bottom list because bottom</span> <span m="1157000">list has everyone. So, that's the algorithm.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1161000">Stop when going right would go too far, and you discover that</span> <span m="1167000">with a comparison. Then you walk down to L_2.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1171000">And then you walk right in L_2 until you find x,</span> <span m="1175000">or you find something greater than x, in which case x is</span> <span m="1180000">definitely not on your list. And you found the predecessor</span> <span m="1186000">and successor, which may be your goal.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1189000">If you didn't find where x was, you should find where it would</span> <span m="1192000">go if it were there, because then maybe you could</span> <span m="1195000">insert there. We're going to use this</span> <span m="1198000">algorithm in insertion. OK, but that search:</span> <span m="1200000">pretty easy at this point. Now, what we haven't discussed</span> <span m="1205000">is how fast the search algorithm is, and it depends,</span> <span m="1208000">of course, which elements we're going to store in L_1,</span> <span m="1212000">which subset of elements should go in L_1.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1214000">Now, in the subway system, you probably put all the</span> <span m="1218000">popular stations in L_1. But here, we want worst-case</span> <span m="1221000">performance. So, we don't have some</span> <span m="1224000">probability distribution on the nodes.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1226000">We just like every node to be accessed sort of as quickly as</span> <span m="1230000">possible, uniformly. So, we want to minimize the</span> <span m="1235000">maximum time over all queries. So, any ideas what we should do</span> <span m="1239000">with L_1? Should I put all the nodes of</span> <span m="1242000">L_1 in the beginning? OK, it's a strict subset.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1246000">Suppose I told you what the size of L_1 was.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1249000">I can tell you, I could afford to build this</span> <span m="1253000">many express stops. How should you distribute them</span> <span m="1256000">among the elements of L_2? Uniformly, good.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1262000">So, what nodes, sorry, what keys,</span> <span m="1268000">let's say, go in L_1? Well, definitely the best thing</span> <span m="1277000">to do is to spread them out uniformly, OK,</span> <span m="1284000">which is definitely not what the 7th Ave line looks like.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1295000">But, let's imagine that we could reengineer everything.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1299000">So, we're going to try to space these things out a little bit</span> <span m="1305000">more. So, 34 and 42nd are way too</span> <span m="1307000">close. We'll take a few more stops.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1310000">And, now we can start to analyze things.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1314000">OK, as a function of the length of L_1.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1317000">So, the cost of a search is now roughly, so, I want a function</span> <span m="1323000">of the length of L_1, and the length of L_2,</span> <span m="1327000">which is all the elements, n.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1331000">What is the cost of the search if I spread out all the elements</span> <span m="1338000">in L_1 uniformly? Yeah?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1340000">Right, the total number of elements in the top lists,</span> <span m="1346000">plus the division between the bottom and the top.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1353000">So, I'll write the length of L_1 plus the length of L_2</span> <span m="1356000">divided by the length of L_1. OK, this is roughly,</span> <span m="1359000">I mean, there's maybe a plus one or so here because in the</span> <span m="1362000">worst case, I have to search through all of L_1 because the</span> <span m="1366000">station I could be looking for could be the max.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1369000">OK, and maybe I'm not lucky, and the max is not on the</span> <span m="1372000">express line. So then, I have to go down to</span> <span m="1374000">the local line. And how many stops will I have</span> <span m="1377000">to go on the local line? Well, L_1 just evenly</span> <span m="1381000">partitions L_2. So this is the number of</span> <span m="1384000">consecutive stations between two express stops.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1388000">So, I take the express, possibly this long,</span> <span m="1392000">but I take the local possibly this long.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1395000">And, this is an L_2. And there is,</span> <span m="1398000">plus, a constant, for example,</span> <span m="1400000">go walking down. But that's basically the number</span> <span m="1404000">of nodes that I visit. So, I'd like to minimize this</span> <span m="1408000">function. Now, L_2, I'm going to call</span> <span m="1416000">that n because that's the total number of elements.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1427000">L_1, I can choose to be whatever I want.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1435000">So, let's go over here. So, I want to minimize L_1 plus</span> <span m="1443000">n over L_1. And I get to choose L_1.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1447000">Now, I could differentiate this, set it to zero,</span> <span m="1451000">and go crazy. Or, I could realize that,</span> <span m="1455000">I mean, that's not hard. But, that's a little bit too</span> <span m="1459000">fancy for me. So, I could say,</span> <span m="1462000">well, this is clearly best when L_1 is small.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1466000">And this is clearly best when L_1 is large.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1472000">So, there's a trade-off there. And, the trade-off will be</span> <span m="1477000">roughly minimized up to constant factors when these two terms are</span> <span m="1484000">equal. That's when I have pretty good</span> <span m="1488000">balance between the two ends of the trade-off.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1493000">So, this is up to constant factors.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1496000">I can let L_1 equal n over L_1, OK, because at most I'm losing</span> <span m="1503000">a factor of two there when they happen to be equal.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1510000">So now, I just solve this. This is really easy.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1514000">This is (L_1)^2 equals n. So, L_1 is the square root of</span> <span m="1518000">n. OK, so the cost that I'm</span> <span m="1520000">getting over here, L_1 plus L_2 over L_1 is the</span> <span m="1524000">square root of n plus n over root n, which is,</span> <span m="1528000">again, root n. So, I get two root n.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1532000">So, search cost, and I'm caring about the</span> <span m="1536000">constant here, because it will matter in a</span> <span m="1539000">moment. Two square root of n:</span> <span m="1541000">I'm not caring about the additive constant,</span> <span m="1545000">but the multiplicative constant I care about.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1548000">OK, that seems good. We started with a linked list</span> <span m="1552000">that searched in n time, theta n time per operation.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1556000">Now we have two linked lists, search and theta root n time.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1563000">It seems pretty good. This is what the structure</span> <span m="1567000">looks like. We have root n guys here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1570000">This is in the local line. And, we have one express stop</span> <span m="1575000">which represents that. But we have another root n</span> <span m="1579000">values in the local line. And we have one express stop</span> <span m="1584000">that represents that. And these two are linked,</span> <span m="1588000">and so on.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1602000">Well, I should put some dot, dot, dots in there.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1604000">OK, so each of these chunks has length root n,</span> <span m="1607000">and the number of representatives up here is</span> <span m="1609000">square root of n. The number of express stops is</span> <span m="1612000">square root of n. So clearly, things are balanced</span> <span m="1614000">now. I search for,</span> <span m="1615000">at most, square root of n up here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1617000">Then I search in one of these lists for, at most,</span> <span m="1620000">square root of n. So, every search takes,</span> <span m="1624000">at most, two root n. Cool, what should we do next?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1630000">So, again, ignore insertions and deletions.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1635000">I want to make searches faster because square root of n is not</span> <span m="1642000">so hot as we know. Sorry?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1645000">More lines. Let's add a super express line,</span> <span m="1650000">or another linked list. OK, this was two.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1655000">Why not do three? So, we started with a sorted</span> <span m="1661000">linked list. Then we went to two.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1665000">This gave us two square root of n.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1668000">Now, I want three sorted linked lists.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1672000">I didn't pluralize here. Any guesses what the running</span> <span m="1677000">time might be? This is just guesswork.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1682000">Don't think. From two square root of n,</span> <span m="1685000">you would go to, sorry?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1688000">Two square root of two, fourth root of n?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1692000">That's on the right track. Both the constant and the root</span> <span m="1697000">change, but not quite so fancily.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1700000">Three times the cubed root: good.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1704000">Intuition is very helpful here. It doesn't matter what the</span> <span m="1709000">right answer is. Use your intuition.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1715000">You can prove that. It's not so hard.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1717000">You now have three lists, and what you want to balance</span> <span m="1720000">are at the length of the top list, the ratio between the top</span> <span m="1724000">two lists, and the ratio between the bottom two lists.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1727000">So, you want these three to multiply out to n,</span> <span m="1730000">because the top times the ratio times the ratio:</span> <span m="1733000">that has to equal n. And, so that's where you get</span> <span m="1736000">the cubed root of n. Each of these should be equal.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1739000">So, you set them because the cost is the sum of those three</span> <span m="1743000">things. So, you set each of them to</span> <span m="1747000">cubed root of n, and there are three of them.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1751000">OK, check it at home if you want to be more sure.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1755000">Obviously, we want a few more. So, let's think about k sorted</span> <span m="1761000">lists. k sorted lists will be k times</span> <span m="1764000">the k'th root of n. You probably guessed that by</span> <span m="1768000">now. So, what should we set k to?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1773000">I don't want the exact minimum. What's a good value for k?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1778000">Should I set it to n? n's kind of nice,</span> <span m="1781000">because the n'th root of n is just one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1784000">Now that's n. So, this is why I cared about</span> <span m="1788000">the lead constant because it's going to grow as I add more</span> <span m="1793000">lists. What's the biggest reasonable</span> <span m="1796000">value of k that I could use? Log n, because I have a k out</span> <span m="1803000">there. I certainly don't want to use</span> <span m="1807000">more than log n. So, log n times the log n'th</span> <span m="1813000">root, and this is a little hard to draw of n.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1818000">Now, what is the log n'th root of n?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1823000">That's what you're all thinking about.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1827000">What is the log n'th root of n minus two?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1834000">It's one of these good questions whose answer is?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1839000">Oh man. Remember the definition of</span> <span m="1843000">root? OK, the root is n to the one</span> <span m="1847000">over log n. OK, good, remember the</span> <span m="1851000">definition of having a power, A to the B?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1855000">It was like two to the power, B log A?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1859000">Does that sound familiar? So, this is two to the log n</span> <span m="1866000">over log n, which is, I hope you can get it at this</span> <span m="1871000">point, two. Wow, so the log n'th root of n</span> <span m="1877000">minus two is zero: my favorite answer.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1880000">OK, this is to. So this whole thing is two log</span> <span m="1883000">n: pretty nifty. So, you could be a little</span> <span m="1886000">fancier and tweak this a little bit, but two log n is plenty</span> <span m="1891000">good for me. We clearly don't want to use</span> <span m="1896000">any more lists, but log n lists sounds pretty</span> <span m="1901000">good. I get, now, logarithmic search</span> <span m="1905000">time. Let's check.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1907000">I mean, we sort of did this all intuitively.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1912000">Let's draw what the list looks like.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1916000">But, it will work. So, I'm going to redraw this</span> <span m="1921000">example because you have to, also.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1927000">So, let's redesign that New York City subway system.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1934000">And, I want you to leave three blank lines up here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1942000">So, you should have this memorized by now.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1949000">But I don't. So, we are not allowed to</span> <span m="1954000">change the local line, though it would be nice,</span> <span m="1958000">add a few more stops there. OK, we can stop at 79th Street.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1963000">That's enough. So now, we have log n lists.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1967000">And here, log n is about four. So, I want to make a bunch of</span> <span m="1973000">lists here. In particular,</span> <span m="1975000">14 will appear on all of them. So, why don't I draw those in?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1982000">And, the question is, which elements go in here?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1985000">So, I have log n lists. And, my goal is to balance the</span> <span m="1988000">number of items up here, and the ratio between these two</span> <span m="1992000">lists, and the ratio between these two lists,</span> <span m="1995000">and the ratio between these two lists.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1998000">I want all these things to be balanced.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2000000">There are log n of them. So, the product of all those</span> <span m="2004000">ratios better be n, the number of elements down</span> <span m="2007000">here. So, the product of all these</span> <span m="2009000">ratios is n. And there's log n of them;</span> <span m="2016000">how big is each ratio? So, I'll call the ratio r.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2024000">The ratio's r. I should have r to the power of</span> <span m="2032000">log n equals n. What's r?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2036000">What's r minus two? Zero.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2042000">OK, this should be two to the power of log n.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2045000">So, if the ratio between the number of elements here and here</span> <span m="2049000">is to all the way down, then I will have an elements at</span> <span m="2052000">the bottom, which is what I want.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2055000">So, in other words, I want half the elements here,</span> <span m="2058000">a quarter of the elements here, an eighth of the elements here,</span> <span m="2062000">and so on. So, I'm going to take half of</span> <span m="2065000">the elements evenly spaced out: 34th, 50th, 66th,</span> <span m="2068000">79th, and so on. So, this is our new</span> <span m="2072000">semi-express line: not terribly fast,</span> <span m="2075000">but you save a factor of two for going up there.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2079000">And, when you're done, you go down,</span> <span m="2082000">and you walk, at most, one step.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2084000">And you find what you're looking for.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2087000">OK, and then we do the same thing over and over and over</span> <span m="2092000">until we run out of elements. I can't read my own writing.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2096000">It's 79th.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2111000">OK, if I had a bigger example, I would be more levels,</span> <span m="2114000">but this is just barely enough. Let's say two elements is where</span> <span m="2119000">I stop. So, this looks good.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2121000">Does this look like a structure you've seen before,</span> <span m="2124000">at all, vaguely? Yes?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2125000">A tree: yes. It looks a lot like a binary</span> <span m="2128000">tree. I'll just leave it at that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2131000">In your problem set, you'll understand why skip</span> <span m="2134000">lists are really like trees. But it's more or less a tree.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2138000">Let's say at this level, it looks sort of like binary</span> <span m="2141000">search. You look at 14;</span> <span m="2142000">you look at 15, and therefore,</span> <span m="2144000">you decide whether you are in the left half for the right</span> <span m="2148000">half. And that's sort of like a tree.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2150000">It's not quite a tree because we have this element repeated</span> <span m="2154000">all over. But more or less,</span> <span m="2155000">this is a binary tree. At depth I, we have two to the</span> <span m="2159000">I nodes, just like a tree, just like a balanced tree.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2164000">I'm going to call this structure an ideal skip list.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2168000">And, if all we are doing our searches, ideal skip lists are</span> <span m="2173000">pretty good. Maybe at practice:</span> <span m="2175000">not quite as good as a binary search tree, but up to constant</span> <span m="2180000">factors: just as good. So, for example,</span> <span m="2184000">I mean, we can generalize search, just check that it's log</span> <span m="2188000">n. So, the search procedure is you</span> <span m="2192000">start at the top left. So, let's say we are looking</span> <span m="2196000">for 72. You start at the top left.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2198000">14 is smaller than 72, so I try to go right.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2201000">79 is too big. So, I follow this arrow,</span> <span m="2204000">but I say, oops, that's too much.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2207000">So, instead, I go down 14 still.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2209000">I go to the right: oh, 50, that's still smaller</span> <span m="2213000">than 72: OK. I tried to go right again.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2215000">Oh: 79, that's too big. That's no good.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2218000">So, I go down. So, I get 50.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2220000">I do the same thing over and over.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2225000">I try to go to the right: oh, 66, that's OK.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2227000">Try to go to the right: oh, 79, that's too big.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2229000">So I go down. Now I go to the right and,</span> <span m="2231000">oh, 72: done. Otherwise, I'd go too far and</span> <span m="2234000">try to go down and say, oops, element must not be</span> <span m="2236000">there. It's a very simple search</span> <span m="2238000">algorithm: same as here except just remove the L_1 and L_2.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2241000">Go right until that would go too far.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2243000">Then go down. Then go right until we'd go too</span> <span m="2245000">far, and then go down. You might have to do this log n</span> <span m="2248000">times. In each level,</span> <span m="2250000">you're clearly only walking a couple of steps because the</span> <span m="2254000">ratio between these two sizes is only two.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2257000">So, this will cost two log n for search.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2260000">Good, I mean, so that was to check because we</span> <span m="2262000">were using intuition over here; a little bit shaky.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2266000">So, this is an ideal skip list, we have to support insertions</span> <span m="2270000">and deletions. As soon as we do an insert and</span> <span m="2273000">delete, there's no way we're going to maintain the structure.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2277000">It's a bit too special. There is only one of these</span> <span m="2283000">where everything is perfectly spaced out, and everything is</span> <span m="2289000">beautiful. So, we can't do that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2293000">We're going to maintain roughly this structure as best we can.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2300000">And, if anyone of you knows someone in New York City subway</span> <span m="2307000">planning, you can tell them this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2311000">OK, so: skip lists. So, I mean, this is basically</span> <span m="2317000">our data structure. You could use this as a</span> <span m="2322000">starting point, but then you start using skip</span> <span m="2326000">lists. And, we need to somehow</span> <span m="2329000">implement insertions and deletions, and maintain roughly</span> <span m="2334000">this structure well enough that the search still costs order log</span> <span m="2341000">n time. So, let's focus on insertions.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2345000">If we do insertions right, it turns out deletions are</span> <span m="2349000">really trivial.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2368000">And again, this is all from first principles.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2371000">We're not allowed to use anything fancy.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2374000">But, it would be nice if we used some good chalk.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2378000">This one looks better. So, suppose you want to insert</span> <span m="2382000">an element, x. We said how to search for an</span> <span m="2386000">element. So, how do we insert it?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2388000">Well, the first thing we should do is figure out where it goes.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2393000">So, we search for x. We call search of x to find</span> <span m="2397000">where x fits in the bottom list, not just any list.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2403000">Pretty easy to find out where it fits in the top list.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2406000">That takes, like, constant time.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2408000">What we want to know: because the top list has</span> <span m="2411000">constant length, we want to know where x goes in</span> <span m="2414000">the bottom list. So, let's say we want to insert</span> <span m="2417000">a search for 80. Well, it is a bit too big.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2419000">Let search for 75. So, we'll find the 75 fits</span> <span m="2422000">right here between 72 and 79 using the same path.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2425000">OK, if it's there already, we complain because I'm going</span> <span m="2429000">to assume all keys are distinct for now just so the picture</span> <span m="2432000">stays simple. But this works fine even if you</span> <span m="2438000">are inserting the same key over and over.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2442000">So, that seems good. One thing we should clearly do</span> <span m="2447000">is insert x into the bottom list.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2450000">We now know where it fits. It should go there.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2455000">Because we want to maintain this invariant,</span> <span m="2459000">that the bottom list contains all the elements.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2466000">So, there we go. We've maintained the invariant.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2470000">The bottom list contains all the elements.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2474000">So, we search for 75. We say, oh, 75 goes here,</span> <span m="2478000">and we just sort of link in 75. You know how to do a linked</span> <span m="2484000">list, I hope. Let me just erase that pointer.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2489000">All the work in implementing skip lists is the linked list</span> <span m="2492000">manipulation. Is that enough?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2494000">No, it would be fine for now because now there's only a chain</span> <span m="2498000">of length three here that you'd have to walk over if you're</span> <span m="2501000">looking for something in this range.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2504000">But if I just keep inserting 75, and 76, than 76 plus</span> <span m="2507000">epsilon, 76 plus two epsilon, and so on, just pack a whole</span> <span m="2511000">bunch of elements in here, this chain will get really</span> <span m="2514000">long. Now, suddenly,</span> <span m="2515000">things are not so balanced. If I do a search,</span> <span m="2518000">I'll pay an arbitrarily long amount time here to search for</span> <span m="2522000">someone. If I insert k things,</span> <span m="2525000">it'll take k time. I want it to stay log n.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2528000">If I only insert log n items, it's OK for now.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2531000">What I want to do is decide which of these lists contain 75.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2535000">So, clearly it goes on the bottom.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2537000">Every element goes in the bottom.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2539000">Should it go up a level? Maybe.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2541000">It depends. It's not clear yet.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2543000">If I insert a few items here, definitely some of them should</span> <span m="2547000">go on the next level. Should I go to levels up?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2559000">Maybe, but even less likely. So, what should I do?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2577000">Yeah? Right, so you maintain the</span> <span m="2581000">ideal partition size, which may be like the length of</span> <span m="2585000">this chain. And you see,</span> <span m="2587000">well, if that gets too long, then I should split it in the</span> <span m="2590000">middle, promote that guy up to the next level,</span> <span m="2594000">and do the same thing up here. If this chain gets too long</span> <span m="2598000">between two consecutive next level express stops,</span> <span m="2601000">then I'll promote the middle guy.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2603000">And that's what you'll do in your problem set.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2606000">That's too fancy for me. I don't need no stinking</span> <span m="2610000">counters. What else could I do?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2626000">I could try to maintain the ideal skip list structure.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2628000">That will be too expensive. Like I say, 75 is the guy that</span> <span m="2631000">gets promoted, and this guy gets demoted all</span> <span m="2634000">the way down. But that will propagate</span> <span m="2635000">everything to the right. And that could cost linear time</span> <span m="2638000">for update. Other idea?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2641000">If I only want half of them to go up, I could flip a coin.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2647000">Good idea. All right, for that,</span> <span m="2651000">I will give you a quarter. It's a good one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2656000">It's the old line state, Maryland.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2659000">There you go. However, you have to perform</span> <span m="2664000">some services for that quarter, namely, flip the coin.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2672000">Can you flip a coin? Good.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2674000">What did you get? Tails, OK, that's the first</span> <span m="2678000">random bit. But we are going to do is build</span> <span m="2682000">a skip list. Maybe I should tell you how</span> <span m="2685000">first. OK, but the idea is flip a</span> <span m="2688000">coin. If it's heads,</span> <span m="2690000">so, sorry, if it's heads, we will promote it to the next</span> <span m="2695000">level, and flip again. So, this is an answer to the</span> <span m="2703000">question, which other lists should store x?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2710000">How many other lists should we add x to?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2716000">Well, the algorithm is, flip a coin,</span> <span m="2722000">and if it comes out heads, then promote x.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2728000">to the next level up, and flip again.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2736000">OK, that's key because we might want this element to go</span> <span m="2739000">arbitrarily high. But for starters,</span> <span m="2741000">we flip a coin. It doesn't go to the next</span> <span m="2743000">level. Well, we'd like it to go to the</span> <span m="2745000">next level with probability one half because we want the ratio</span> <span m="2749000">between these two sizes to be a half, or sorry,</span> <span m="2751000">two, depending which way you take the ratio.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2754000">So, I want roughly half the elements up here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2756000">So, I flip a coin. If it comes up heads,</span> <span m="2758000">I go up here. This is a fair coin.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2762000">So I want it 50-50. OK, then how many should that</span> <span m="2765000">element go up to the next level up?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2767000">Well, with 50% probability again.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2769000">So, I flip another point. If it comes up heads,</span> <span m="2772000">I'll go up another level. And that will maintain the</span> <span m="2775000">approximate ratio between these two guys as being two.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2779000">The expected ratio will definitely be two,</span> <span m="2781000">and so on, all the way up. If I go up to the top and flip</span> <span m="2785000">a coin, it comes up heads, I'll make another level.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2788000">This is the insertion algorithm: dead simple.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2793000">The fancier one you will see on your problem set.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2798000">So, let's do it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2809000">OK, I also need someone to generate random numbers.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2813000">Who can generate random numbers?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2816000">Pseudo-random? I'll give you a quarter.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2820000">I have one here. Here you go.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2822000">That's a boring quarter. Who would like to generate</span> <span m="2825000">random numbers? Someone volunteering someone</span> <span m="2828000">else: that's a good way to do it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2830000">Here you go. You get a quarter,</span> <span m="2833000">but you're not allowed to flip it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2835000">No randomness for you; well, OK, you can generate</span> <span m="2838000">bits, and then compute a number. So, give me a number.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2842000">44, can answer. OK, we already flipped a coin</span> <span m="2845000">and I got tails. Done.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2847000">That's the insertion algorithm. I'm going to make some more</span> <span m="2853000">space actually, put it way down here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2856000">OK, so 44 does not get promoted because we got a tails.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2861000">So, give me another number. Nine, OK, I search for nine in</span> <span m="2866000">this list. I should mention one other</span> <span m="2869000">thing, sorry. I need a small change.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2873000">This is just to make sure searches still work.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2877000">So, the worry is suppose I insert something bigger and then</span> <span m="2882000">I promote it. This would look very bad for a</span> <span m="2887000">skip list data structure because I always want to start at the</span> <span m="2891000">top left, and now there's no top left.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2893000">So, just minor change: just let me remember that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2897000">The minor change is that I'm going to store a special value</span> <span m="2901000">minus infinity in every list. So, minus infinity always gets</span> <span m="2905000">promoted all the way to the top, whatever the top happens to be</span> <span m="2909000">now. So, initially,</span> <span m="2912000">that way I'll always have a top left.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2915000">Sorry, I forgot to mention that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2918000">So, initially I'll just have minus infinity.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2921000">Then I insert 44. I say, OK, 44 goes there,</span> <span m="2925000">no promotion, done.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2927000">Now, we're going to insert nine.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2929000">Nine goes here. So, minus infinity to nine,</span> <span m="2933000">flip your coin, heads.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2935000">Did he actually flip it? OK, good.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2940000">He flipped it before, yeah, sure.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2942000">I'm just giving you a hard time.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2944000">So, we have nine up here. We need to maintain this minus</span> <span m="2949000">infinity just to make sure it gets promoted along with</span> <span m="2953000">everything else. So, that looks like a nice skip</span> <span m="2956000">list. Flip it again.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2958000">Tails, good. OK, so this looks like an ideal</span> <span m="2961000">skip list. Isn't that great?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2963000">It works every time. OK, give me another number.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2967000">26, OK, so I search for 26. 26 goes here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2972000">It clearly goes on the bottom list.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2976000">Here we go, 26, and then I you raised 44.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2981000">Flip. Tails, OK, another number.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2986000">50, oh, a big one. It costs me a little while to</span> <span m="2992000">search, and I get over here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2996000">Flip. Heads, good.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2998000">So 50 gets promoted. Flip it again.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3005000">Tails, OK, still a reasonable number.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3008000">Another number? 12, it takes a little while to</span> <span m="3011000">get exciting here. OK, 12 goes here between nine</span> <span m="3015000">and 26. You're giving me a hard time</span> <span m="3018000">here. OK, flip.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3020000">Heads, OK, 12 gets promoted. I know you have to work a</span> <span m="3024000">little bit, but we just came here to search for 12.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3030000">So, we know that nine was the last point we went down.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3035000">So, we promote 12. It gets inserted up here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3039000">We are just inserting into this particular linked list:</span> <span m="3045000">nothing fancy. We link the two twelves</span> <span m="3048000">together. It still looks kind of like a</span> <span m="3052000">linked list. Flip again.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3055000">OK, tails, another number.</span> <span m="3058000">Jeez. It's a good test of memory.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3062000">37, what was it, 44 and 50?</span> </p>
<p><span m="3065000">And 50 was at the next level up.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3068000">I think I should just keep appending elements and have you</span> <span m="3074000">flip coins. OK, we just inserted 37.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3078000">Tails. OK, that's getting to be a long</span> <span m="3082000">chain. That looks a bit worse.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3085000">OK, give me another number larger than 50.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3089000">51, good answer. Thank you.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3094000">OK, flip again. And again.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3097000">Tails. Another number.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3100000">Wait, someone else should pick a number.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3105000">It's not working. What did you say?</span> </p>
<p><span m="3109000">52, good answer. Flip.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3112000">Tails, not surprising. We've gotten a lot of heads</span> <span m="3118000">there. OK, another number.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3123000">53, thank you. Flip.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3126000">Heads, heads, OK.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3128000">Heads, heads, you didn't flip.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3133000">All right, 53, you get the idea.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3137000">If you get two consecutive heads, then the guy goes up two</span> <span m="3146000">levels. OK, now flip for real.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3152000">Heads. Finally.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3153000">Heads we've been waiting for. If you flipped three heads in a</span> <span m="3159000">row, you go three levels. And each time,</span> <span m="3164000">we keep promoting minus infinity.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3167000">Look again. Heads, oh my God.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3170000">Where were they before? Flip again.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3174000">It better be tails this time. Tails, good.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3180000">OK, you get the idea. Eventually you run out of board</span> <span m="3184000">space. Now, it's pretty rare that you</span> <span m="3186000">go too high. What's the probability that you</span> <span m="3190000">go higher than log n? Another easy log computation.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3193000">Each time, I have a 50% probability of going up.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3197000">One in n probability of going up log n levels because half to</span> <span m="3202000">the power of log n is one out of n.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3204000">So, it depends on n, but I'm not going to go too</span> <span m="3208000">high. And, intuitively,</span> <span m="3212000">this is not so bad. So, these are skip lists.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3217000">You have the ratios right in expectation, which is a pretty</span> <span m="3224000">weak statement. This doesn't say anything about</span> <span m="3229000">the lengths of these change. But intuitively,</span> <span m="3234000">it's pretty good. Let's say pretty good on</span> <span m="3239000">average. So, I had two semi-random</span> <span m="3243000">processes going on here. One is picking the numbers,</span> <span m="3245000">and that, I don't want to assume anything about.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3248000">The numbers could be adversarial.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3249000">It could be sequential. It could be reverse sorted.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3252000">It could be random. I don't know.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3254000">So, it didn't matter what he said.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3255000">At least, it shouldn't matter. I mean, it matters here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3258000">Don't worry. You're still loved.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3260000">You still get your $0.25. But what the algorithm cares</span> <span m="3262000">about is the outcomes of these coins.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3264000">And the probability, the statement that this data</span> <span m="3267000">structure is fast with high probability is only about the</span> <span m="3270000">random coins. Right, it doesn't matter what</span> <span m="3274000">the adversary chooses for numbers as long as those coins</span> <span m="3278000">are random, and the adversary doesn't know the coins.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3283000">It doesn't know the outcomes of the coins.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3286000">So, in that case, on average, overall of the coin</span> <span m="3290000">flips, you should be OK. But the claim is not just that</span> <span m="3295000">it's pretty good on average. But, it's really,</span> <span m="3298000">really good almost always. OK, with really high</span> <span m="3303000">probability it's log n. So, for example,</span> <span m="3307000">with probability, one minus one over n,</span> <span m="3310000">it's order of log n, with probability one minus one</span> <span m="3315000">over n^2 it's log n, probability one minus one over</span> <span m="3319000">n^100, it's order log n. All those statements are true</span> <span m="3324000">for any value of 100. So, that's where we're going.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3330000">OK, I should mention, how do you delete in a skip</span> <span m="3333000">list? Find the element.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3334000">You delete it all the way. There's nothing fancy with</span> <span m="3337000">delete. Because we have all these</span> <span m="3340000">independent, random choices, all of these elements are sort</span> <span m="3343000">of independent from each other. We don't really care.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3347000">So, delete an element, just throw it away.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3349000">The tricky part is insertion. When I insert an element,</span> <span m="3353000">I'm just going to randomly see how high it should go.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3356000">With probability one over two to the i, it will go to height</span> <span m="3360000">i. Good, that's my time.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3364000">I've been having too much fun here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3368000">I've got to go a little bit faster, OK.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3385000">So here's the theorem. Let's see exactly what we are</span> <span m="3392000">proving first. With high probability,</span> <span m="3398000">this is a formal notion which I will define a second.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3406000">Every search in n elements skip lists costs order of log n.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3415000">So, that's the theorem. Now I need to define with high</span> <span m="3423000">probability. So, with high probability.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3426000">And, it's a bit of a long phrase.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3430000">So, often we will, and you can abbreviate it WHP.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3435000">So, if I have a random event, and the random event here is</span> <span m="3440000">that every search in an n element skip list costs order</span> <span m="3446000">log n, I want to know what it means for that event E to occur</span> <span m="3452000">with high probability.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3467000">So this is the definition. So, the statement is that for</span> <span m="3473000">any alpha greater than or equal to one, there is a suitable</span> <span m="3480000">choice of constants --</span> <span m="3496000">-- for which the event, E, occurs with this probability</span> <span m="3507000">I keep mentioning. So, the probability at least</span> <span m="3517000">one minus one over n to the alpha.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3526000">So, this is a bit imprecise, but it will suffice for our</span> <span m="3529000">purposes. If you want to really formal</span> <span m="3532000">definition, you can read the lecture notes.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3535000">There are special lecture notes for this lecture on the stellar</span> <span m="3539000">site. And, there's the PowerPoint</span> <span m="3541000">notes on the SMA site. But, right, there's a bit of a</span> <span m="3546000">subtlety in the choice of constants here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3548000">There is a choice of this constant.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3551000">And there's a choice of this constant.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3554000">And, these are related. And, there's alpha,</span> <span m="3556000">which we get to whatever we want.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3559000">But the bottom line is, we get to choose what</span> <span m="3562000">probability we want this to be true.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3564000">If I want it to be true, with probability one minus one</span> <span m="3568000">over n^100, I can do that. I just sat alpha to a hundred,</span> <span m="3572000">and up to this little constant that's going to grow much slower</span> <span m="3577000">than n to the alpha. I get the error probability.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3581000">So this thing is called the error probability.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3585000">The probability that I fail is polynomially small,</span> <span m="3588000">for any polynomial I want. Now, with the same data</span> <span m="3591000">structure, right, I fixed the data structure.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3594000">It doesn't depend on alpha. Anything you want,</span> <span m="3597000">any alpha value you want, this data structure will take</span> <span m="3601717">order of log n time. Now, this constant will depend</span> <span m="3606692">on alpha. So, you know,</span> <span m="3608666">you want error probability one over n^100 is probably going to</span> <span m="3614141">be, like, 100 log n. It's still log n.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3617461">OK, this is a very strong claim about the tale of the</span> <span m="3622128">distribution of the running time of search, very strong.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3627064">Let me give you an idea of how strong it is.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3632000">How many people know what Boole's inequality is?</span> </p>
<p><span m="3636731">How many people know what the union bound is in probability?</span> </p>
<p><span m="3642671">You should. It's in appendix c.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3645691">Maybe you'll know it by the theorem.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3649214">It's good to know it by name. It's sort of like linearity of</span> <span m="3655154">expectations. It's a lot easier to</span> <span m="3658476">communicate to someone. Linearity of expectations:</span> <span m="3663978">instead of saying, you know that thing where you</span> <span m="3667554">sum up all the expectations of things, and that's the</span> <span m="3671510">expectation of the sum? It's a lot easier to say</span> <span m="3675086">linearity of expectation. So, let me quiz you in a</span> <span m="3678815">different way. So, if I take a bunch of</span> <span m="3681706">events, and I take their union, either this happens or this</span> <span m="3686119">happens, or so on. So, this is the inclusive OR of</span> <span m="3689847">k events. And, instead,</span> <span m="3691521">I look at the sum of the probabilities of those events.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3697000">OK, easy question: are these equal?</span> </p>
<p><span m="3700111">No, unless they are independent.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3702947">But can I say anything about them, any relation?</span> </p>
<p><span m="3707248">Smaller, yeah. This is less than or equal to</span> <span m="3711183">that. OK, this should be intuitive to</span> <span m="3714477">you from a probability point of view.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3717771">Look at the textbook. OK: very basic result,</span> <span m="3721705">trivial result almost. What does this tell us?</span> </p>
<p><span m="3727041">Well, suppose that E_i is some kind of error event.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3731479">We don't want it to happen. OK, and suppose,</span> <span m="3735295">mix some letters here. Suppose I have a bunch of</span> <span m="3739467">events which occur with high probability.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3743017">OK, call those E_i complement. So, suppose,</span> <span m="3746745">so this is the end of that statement, E_i complement occurs</span> <span m="3751893">with high probability. OK, so then the probability of</span> <span m="3757063">E_i is very small, polynomially small.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3759609">One over n to the alpha for any alpha I want.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3762636">Now, suppose I take a whole bunch of these events,</span> <span m="3766007">and let's say that k is polynomial in n.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3768690">So, I take a bunch of events, which I'd like to happen.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3772405">They all occur with high probability.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3774882">There is only polynomially many of them.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3777565">So let's say, let me give this constant a</span> <span m="3780316">name. Let's call it c.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3783000">Let's say I take n to the c such events.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3785873">Well, what's the probability that all those events occur</span> <span m="3789926">together? Because they should rest of the</span> <span m="3792873">time occurred together because each one occurs most of the</span> <span m="3797073">time, occurs with high probability.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3799578">So, I want to look at E_1 bar intersect, E_2 bar,</span> <span m="3803115">and so on. So, each of these occurs as</span> <span m="3805842">high probability. What's the chance that they all</span> <span m="3809378">occur? It's also with high</span> <span m="3812166">probability. I'm changing the alpha.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3814316">So, the union bound tells me the probability of any one of</span> <span m="3817817">these failing, the probability of this</span> <span m="3820090">failing, or this failing, or this failing,</span> <span m="3822608">which is this thing, is, at most,</span> <span m="3824573">the sum of the probabilities of each failure.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3827276">These are the error probabilities.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3829303">I know that each of them is, at most, one over n to the</span> <span m="3832619">alpha, with a constant in front. If I add them all up,</span> <span m="3835875">there's only n to the c of them.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3837779">So, I take this error probability, and I multiply by n</span> <span m="3841034">to the c. So, I get like n to the c over</span> <span m="3845400">n to the alpha, which is one over n to the</span> <span m="3848679">alpha minus c. I can set alpha as big as I</span> <span m="3851960">want. So, I said it much,</span> <span m="3853880">much bigger than c, and this event occurs with high</span> <span m="3857880">probability. I sort of made a mess here,</span> <span m="3861000">but this event occurs with high probability because of this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3865719">Whatever the constant is here, however many events I'm taking,</span> <span m="3870599">I just set alpha to be bigger than that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3875000">And, this event will occur with high probability,</span> <span m="3877951">too. So, when I say here that every</span> <span m="3880041">search of cost order log n with high probability,</span> <span m="3882992">not only do I mean that if you look at one search,</span> <span m="3886005">it costs order log n with high probability.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3888587">You look at another search, and it costs log n with high</span> <span m="3891969">probability. I mean, if you take every</span> <span m="3894244">search, all of them take order log n time with high</span> <span m="3897318">probability. So, this event that every</span> <span m="3899593">single search you do takes order log n, is true with high</span> <span m="3903036">probability estimate the number of searches you are doing is</span> <span m="3906663">polynomial in n. So, I'm assuming that I'm not</span> <span m="3910887">using this data structure forever, just for a polynomial</span> <span m="3914467">amount of time. But, who's got more than a</span> <span m="3917136">polynomial amount of time anyway?</span> </p>
<p><span m="3919218">This is MIT. So, hopefully that's clear.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3921757">We'll see it a few more times. Yeah?</span> </p>
<p><span m="3924035">The algorithm doesn't depend on Alpha.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3926443">The question is how do you choose alpha in the algorithm.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3931000">So, we don't need to. This is just sort of for an</span> <span m="3933925">analysis tool. This is saying that the farther</span> <span m="3936668">out you get, so you say, well, what's the probability</span> <span m="3939838">that more than ten log n. Well, it's like one over n^10.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3943190">Let's say it's linear. Well, what's the chance that</span> <span m="3946238">you're more than 20 log n? Well that's one over n^20.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3949407">So, the point is the tail of this distribution is getting a</span> <span m="3952942">really small, really fast.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3954466">And, such using alpha is more like sort of for your own</span> <span m="3957758">feeling good. OK, you can set it to 100,</span> <span m="3960135">and then n is at least two. So, that's like one over 2^100</span> <span m="3965209">chance that you fail. That's damn small.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3968082">If you've got a real random number generator,</span> <span m="3971322">the chance that you're going to hit one over 2^200 is pretty</span> <span m="3975668">tiny, right? So, let's say you set alpha to</span> <span m="3978762">256, which is always a good number.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3981266">2^256 is much bigger than the number of particles in the known</span> <span m="3985759">universe, so, the light matter.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3989000">So, actually I think this even accounts for some notion of dark</span> <span m="3992898">matter. So, this is really,</span> <span m="3994533">really, really big. So, the chance that you pick a</span> <span m="3997615">random particle in the universe that happens to be your favorite</span> <span m="4001576">particle, this one right here, that's over one over 2^256,</span> <span m="4005161">or even smaller. So, set alpha to 256,</span> <span m="4007487">the chance to your algorithm takes more than order log n time</span> <span m="4011260">is a lot smaller than the chance that a meteor strikes your</span> <span m="4014907">computer at the same time that it has a flooding point error,</span> <span m="4018680">at the same time that the earth explodes because they're putting</span> <span m="4022642">a transport through this part of the solar system at the same</span> <span m="4026415">time, I mean, I could go on,</span> <span m="4028113">right? It's really,</span> <span m="4030752">really unlikely that you are more than log n.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4033510">And how unlikely: you get to choose.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4035705">But it's just in the analysis the algorithm doesn't depend on</span> <span m="4039467">it. It's the same algorithm,</span> <span m="4041159">very cool. Sometimes, with high</span> <span m="4043040">probability, bounds depends on alpha.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4045297">I mean, the algorithm depends on alpha.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4047680">But here, it will not. OK, away we go.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4052307">So now you all understand the claim.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4057692">So let's do a warm up. We will also need this fact.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4065384">But it's pretty easy. The lemma is that with high</span> <span m="4072769">probability, the number of levels in the skip list is order</span> <span m="4081692">log n. I think it's order log n,</span> <span m="4086266">certainly. So, how do we prove that</span> <span m="4089349">something happens with high probably?</span> </p>
<p><span m="4092613">Compute the probability that it happened; show that it's high.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4098144">Even if you don't know what high probability means,</span> <span m="4102676">in fact, I used to ask that earlier on.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4106122">So, let's compute the chance that it doesn't happen,</span> <span m="4110746">the error probability, because that's just a one minus</span> <span m="4115551">the cleaner. So, I'd like to say,</span> <span m="4119448">let's say, that it's, at most, c log n levels.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4122710">So, what's the error probability for that event?</span> </p>
<p><span m="4126115">This is sort of an event. I'll put it in squiggles just</span> <span m="4130028">for, all set. This is the probability that</span> <span m="4133000">they are strictly greater than c log n levels.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4136260">So, I want to say that that probability is particularly</span> <span m="4140173">small, polynomially small. Well, how do I make levels?</span> </p>
<p><span m="4144683">When I insert an element, the probability half,</span> <span m="4147551">it goes up. And, the number of levels in</span> <span m="4149984">the skip list is the max over all the elements of how high it</span> <span m="4153725">goes up. But, max, oh,</span> <span m="4155035">that's a mess. All right, you can compute the</span> <span m="4157779">expectation of the max if you have a bunch of unknown</span> <span m="4161022">variables; there is expectation there is a constant,</span> <span m="4164202">and you take the max. It's like log in and</span> <span m="4166759">expectation, but we want a much stronger statement.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4171000">And, we have this Boole's inequality that says I have a</span> <span m="4175815">bunch of things, polynomially many things.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4179471">Let's say we have n items. Each one independently,</span> <span m="4183841">I don't even care if it's a dependent.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4187142">If it goes up more than c log n, yeah, the number of levels is</span> <span m="4192582">more than c log n. So, this is,</span> <span m="4195258">at most, and then I want to know, do any of those events</span> <span m="4200163">happen for any of the n elements?</span> </p>
<p><span m="4203017">So, I just multiplied by n. It's certainly,</span> <span m="4206762">at most, n times the probability that x gets</span> <span m="4210597">promoted, this much here, greater than or equal to log n</span> <span m="4215502">times. OK, if I pick,</span> <span m="4218734">for any element, x, because it's the same for</span> <span m="4221041">each element. They are done independently.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4223191">So, I'm just summing over x here, and that's just a factor</span> <span m="4226179">of n. Clear?</span> </p>
<p><span m="4226756">This is Boole's inequality. Now, what's the probability</span> <span m="4229588">that x gets promoted c log n times?</span> </p>
<p><span m="4232000">We did this before for log n. It was one over n.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4236646">For c log n, it's one over n to the c.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4240305">OK, this is n times two. Let's be nicer:</span> <span m="4244161">one half to the power of c log n.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4247324">One half to the power of c log n is one over two to the c log</span> <span m="4253257">n. The log n comes out here,</span> <span m="4255926">becomes an n. We get n to the c.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4258991">So, this is n divided by n to the c, which is n to the c minus</span> <span m="4265022">one. And, I get to choose c to be</span> <span m="4269904">whatever I want. So, I choose c minus one to be</span> <span m="4274676">alpha. I think exactly that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4277477">Oh, sorry, one over n to the c minus one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4281626">Thank you. It better be small.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4284634">This is an upper bound. So, probability is polynomially</span> <span m="4290236">small. I get to choose,</span> <span m="4292956">and this is a bit of the trik. I'm choosing this constant to</span> <span m="4296484">be large, large enough for alpha.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4298397">The point is, as c grows, alpha grows.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4300610">Therefore, I can set alpha to be whatever I want,</span> <span m="4303480">set c accordingly. So, there's a little bit more</span> <span m="4306290">words that have to go here. But, they're in the notes.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4309459">I can set alpha to be as large as I want.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4311851">So, I can make this probability as small as I want in the</span> <span m="4315199">polynomial sets. So, that's it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4316993">Number of levels, order log n:</span> <span m="4318727">wasn't that easy? Rules and equality,</span> <span m="4322224">the point is that when you're dealing with high probability,</span> <span m="4326026">use Boole's inequality. And, anything that's true for</span> <span m="4329377">one element is true for all of them, just like that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4332664">Just lose a factor of n, but that's just one in the</span> <span m="4335886">alpha, and alpha is big: big constant,</span> <span m="4338271">but it's big. OK, so let's prove the theorem.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4341106">High probability searches cost order log n.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4343813">We now know the height is order log n, but it depends how</span> <span m="4347422">balanced this thing is. It depends how long the chains</span> <span m="4352756">are to really know that a search costs log n.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4356800">Just knowing a bound on the height is not enough,</span> <span m="4361210">unlike a binary tree. So, we have one cool idea for</span> <span m="4365805">this analysis. And it's called backwards</span> <span m="4369389">analysis. So, normally you think of a</span> <span m="4372697">search as starting in the top left corner going left and down</span> <span m="4378210">until you get to the item that you're looking for.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4384000">I'm going to look at the reverse process.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4387423">You start at the item you're looking for, and you go left and</span> <span m="4392558">up until you get to the top left corner.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4395896">The number of steps in those two walks is the same.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4400175">And, I'm not implementing an algorithm here,</span> <span m="4403855">I'm just doing analysis. So, those are the same</span> <span m="4407792">processes, just in reverse. So, here's what it looks like.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4412671">You have a search, and it starts,</span> <span m="4415409">which really means that it ends at a node in the bottom list.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4422000">Then, each time you visit a node in this search,</span> <span m="4426845">you either go left or up. And, when do you go left or up?</span> </p>
<p><span m="4432618">Well, it depends with the coin flip was.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4436639">So, if the node wasn't promoted at this level.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4442000">So, if it wasn't promoted higher, and that happened</span> <span m="4448317">exactly when we got a tails. Then, we go left,</span> <span m="4454003">which really means we came from the left.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4459057">Or, if we got a heads, so if this node was promoted to</span> <span m="4465754">the next level, which happened whenever we got</span> <span m="4471440">a heads at that particular moment.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4477000">This is in the past some time when we did the insertion.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4482860">Then we go, or came from, up.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4485844">And, we stop at the root. This is really where we start;</span> <span m="4491704">same thing. So, either at the root or I'm</span> <span m="4495967">also going to think of this as stopping at minus infinity.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4503000">OK, that was a bit messy, but let me review.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4505562">So, normally we start up here. Well, just looking at</span> <span m="4508602">everything backwards, and in brackets is what's</span> <span m="4511344">really happening. So, this search ends at the</span> <span m="4513966">node you were looking for. It's always in the bottom list.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4517364">Then it says, well, was this node promoted</span> <span m="4519807">higher? If it was, I came from above.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4521952">If not, I came to the left. It must have been in the bottom</span> <span m="4525410">chain somewhere. OK, and that's true at every</span> <span m="4528033">node you visit. It depends whether that quite</span> <span m="4531870">slipped heads or tails at the time that you inserted that node</span> <span m="4535806">into that level. But, these are just a bunch of</span> <span m="4538774">events. I'm just going to check,</span> <span m="4540774">what is the probability that its heads, and what is the</span> <span m="4544258">probability that a tails? It's always a half.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4547096">Every time I look at a coin flip, when it was flipped,</span> <span m="4550516">there was a probability of half going out of their way.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4554000">That's the magic. And, I'm not using that these</span> <span m="4556967">events are independent anyway. For every element that I search</span> <span m="4562248">for, for every value, x, that's another search.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4565584">Those events may not be independent.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4568123">I can still use Boole's inequality and conclude that all</span> <span m="4572112">of them are order log n with high probability.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4575375">As long as I can prove that any one event happens with high</span> <span m="4579582">probability. So, I don't need independence</span> <span m="4582556">between, I knew that these coin flips in a single search are</span> <span m="4586835">independent, but everything else, for different searches I</span> <span m="4590969">don't care. So, how long can this process</span> <span m="4595803">go on? We want to know how many times</span> <span m="4599283">can I make this walk? Well, when I hit the root node,</span> <span m="4604309">I'm done. Well, how quickly would I hit</span> <span m="4607983">the root node? Well, with probability,</span> <span m="4611559">a half, I go up each step. The number of times I go up is,</span> <span m="4617068">at most, the number of levels minus one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4622000">And that's order log n with high probability.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4625410">So, this is the only other idea.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4627813">So, we are now improving this theorem.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4630682">So, the number of up moves in a search, which are really down</span> <span m="4635333">moves, but same thing, is less than the number of</span> <span m="4639054">levels. Certainly, you can't go up more</span> <span m="4642000">than there are levels in the search.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4644713">And in insert, you can go arbitrarily high.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4647968">But a search: as high as you can go.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4652000">And this is, at most, c log n with high</span> <span m="4654821">probability. This is what we proved in the</span> <span m="4657866">lemma. So, we have a bound on the</span> <span m="4660242">number of up moves. Half of the moves,</span> <span m="4662990">roughly, are going to be up moves.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4665440">So, this pretty much down to the number of moves.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4669004">Not quite. So, what this means is that</span> <span m="4671752">with high probability, so this is the same</span> <span m="4674797">probability, but I could choose that as high as I want by</span> <span m="4678955">setting c large enough. The number of moves,</span> <span m="4683553">in other words, the cost of the search is at</span> <span m="4686893">most the number of coin flips until we get c long n heads,</span> <span m="4691320">right, because in every step of the search, I make a move,</span> <span m="4695747">and then I flip another coin, conceptually.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4699009">There is another independent coin lying there.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4702504">And it's either heads or tails. Each of those is independent.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4707165">So, how many independent coin flips does it take until I get c</span> <span m="4711902">log n heads? The claim is that that's order</span> <span m="4717206">log n with high probability. But we need to prove that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4722979">So, this is a claim. So, if you just sit there with</span> <span m="4728324">a coin, and you want to know how many times does it take until I</span> <span m="4735058">get c log n heads, the claim is that that number</span> <span m="4740082">is order log n with high probability.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4745000">As long as I prove that, I know that the total number of</span> <span m="4748595">steps I make, which is the number of heads</span> <span m="4751276">and tails is order log n because I definitely know the number of</span> <span m="4755394">heads is, at most, c log n.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4757094">The claim is that the number of tails can't be too much bigger.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4761147">Notice, I can't just say c here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4763174">OK, it's really important that I have log n.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4765985">Why? Because with high probability,</span> <span m="4768208">it depends on n. This notion depends on n.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4772000">Log n: it's true. Anything bigger that log n:</span> <span m="4775434">it's true, like n. If I put n here,</span> <span m="4778087">this is also true. But, if I put a constant or a</span> <span m="4781756">log log n, this is not true. It's really important that I</span> <span m="4786126">have log n here because my notion of high probability</span> <span m="4790184">depends on what's written here. OK, it's clear so far.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4794321">We're almost done, which is good because I just</span> <span m="4797912">ran out of time. Sorry, we're going to go a</span> <span m="4801190">couple minutes over. So, I want to compute the error</span> <span m="4807528">probability here. So, I want to compute the</span> <span m="4812308">probability that there is less than c log n heads.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4817886">Let me skip this step. So, I will be approximate and</span> <span m="4823691">say, what's the probability that there is, at most,</span> <span m="4829382">c log n heads? So, I need to say how many</span> <span m="4833923">coins we are flipping here for what this event is.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4837549">So, I need to specify this constant.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4840139">Let's say we flip ten c log n coins.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4842729">Now I want to look at the error probability under that event.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4847169">The probability that there is at most c log n heads among</span> <span m="4851312">those ten c log n flips. So, the claim is this should be</span> <span m="4855382">pretty small. It's going to depend on ten.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4858416">Then I'll choose ten to be arbitrarily large,</span> <span m="4861672">and I'll be done, OK, make my life a little bit</span> <span m="4865076">easier. Well, I would ask you normally,</span> <span m="4870054">but this is 6.042 material. So, what's the probability that</span> <span m="4875770">we have, at most, this many heads?</span> </p>
<p><span m="4879021">Well, that means that nine c log n of the coins,</span> <span m="4883653">because there are ten c log n flips, c log n heads at most,</span> <span m="4889368">nine c log n at least better be tails.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4894000">So this is the probability that all those other guys become</span> <span m="4897148">tails, which is already pretty small.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4899104">And then, there is this permutation thing.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4901330">So, if I had exactly c log n heads, this would be the number</span> <span m="4904532">of ways to rearrange c log n heads among ten c log n coin</span> <span m="4907574">flips. OK, that's just the number of</span> <span m="4909475">permutations. So, this is a bit big,</span> <span m="4911375">which is kind of annoying. This is really,</span> <span m="4913601">really small. The claim is this is much</span> <span m="4915665">smaller than that is big.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4934000">So, this is just some math. I'm going to whiz through it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4938548">So, you don't have to stay too long.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4941390">But you should go over it. You should know that y choose x</span> <span m="4946020">is, at most, ey over x to the x, good fact.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4950000">Therefore, this is, at most, ten c log n over c log</span> <span m="4955032">n, also known as ten. These cancel.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4958456">There's an e out here. And then I raise that to the c</span> <span m="4963691">log n power. OK, then I divide by two to the</span> <span m="4968020">power, nine c log n. OK, so what's this?</span> </p>
<p><span m="4971946">This is e times ten to the c log n divided by two to the nine</span> <span m="4977986">c log n. OK, claim this is very big.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4982355">This is not so big, because I have a nine here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4986367">So, let's work it out. This e times ten,</span> <span m="4989769">that's a good number, we can put upstairs.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4993345">So, we get log of e times ten, ten times, e,</span> <span m="4997096">and then c log n. And then, we have over two to</span> <span m="5001109">the nine c log n. So, we have this two to the c</span> <span m="5005121">log n in both cases. So, this is two to the log,</span> <span m="5011946">ten e minus nine, c, log n: some basic algebra.</span> </p>
<p><span m="5018669">So, I'm going to set, not quite.</span> </p>
<p><span m="5023199">This is one over two to the nine minus log:</span> <span m="5029338">so, just inverting everything here, negating the sign in here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="5038253">And, this is my alpha because the rest is n.</span> </p>
<p><span m="5046000">So, this is one over n to the alpha when alpha is this</span> <span m="5049903">particular value: nine minus log of ten times e</span> <span m="5053291">times c. It's a bit of a strange thing.</span> </p>
<p><span m="5056090">But, the point is, as ten goes to infinity,</span> <span m="5059184">nine here is the number one smaller than ten,</span> <span m="5062424">right? We subtracted one somewhere</span> <span m="5064855">along the way. So, as ten goes to infinity,</span> <span m="5067949">this is basically, this is ten minus one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="5072000">This is log of ten times e. e doesn't really matter.</span> </p>
<p><span m="5075100">The point is, this is logarithmic in ten.</span> </p>
<p><span m="5077531">This is linear in ten. The thing that's linear in ten</span> <span m="5080692">is much bigger than the thing that's logarithmic in ten.</span> </p>
<p><span m="5084035">This is called abusive notation.</span> </p>
<p><span m="5085919">OK, as ten goes to infinity, this goes to infinity,</span> <span m="5088958">gets bigger. And, there is a c out here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="5091329">But, for any value of c that you want, whatever value of c</span> <span m="5094794">you wanted in that claim, I can make alpha arbitrarily</span> <span m="5098015">large by changing the constant in the big O,</span> <span m="5100629">which here was ten. OK, so that claim is true with</span> <span m="5104812">high probability. Whatever probability you want,</span> <span m="5107652">which tells you alpha, you set a constant effort of</span> <span m="5110673">the log N to be this number, which grows,</span> <span m="5113089">and you're done. You get the claim that is order</span> <span m="5115929">log N heads, order log N flips with the high probability,</span> <span m="5119312">therefore. [None of the steps?] in the</span> <span m="5121548">search is order log N with high probability.</span> </p>
<p><span m="5124146">Really cool stuff; read the notes.</span> </p>
<p><span m="5126140">Sorry I went so fast at the end.</span> </p>
