<p><span m="1000">It starts out at p plus 1 so This is called, So, once again,</span> <span m="8000">OK. Today we are going to talk</span> <span m="11000">about a very interesting algorithm called Quicksort --</span> <span m="23000">-- which was invented by Tony Hoare in 1962.</span> </p>
<p><span m="30000">And it has ended up being a really interesting algorithm</span> <span m="35000">from many points of view. And because of that,</span> <span m="40000">it turns out today's lecture is going to be both hard and fast.</span> </p>
<p><span m="47000">If you see the person next to you sleeping,</span> <span m="52000">you will want to say let's get going.</span> </p>
<p><span m="56000">It's a divide-and-conquer algorithm.</span> </p>
<p><span m="66000">And it sorts, as they say,</span> <span m="68000">in place, meaning that it just rearranged the elements where</span> <span m="74000">they are. That is like insertion sort</span> <span m="77000">rearranges elements where they are.</span> </p>
<p><span m="80000">Mergesort does not. Mergesort requires extra</span> <span m="84000">storage in order to do the merge operation.</span> </p>
<p><span m="90000">To merge in linear time and place, it doesn't merge in place</span> <span m="94000">in linear time. It doesn't do it just by</span> <span m="97000">rearranging. It is nice because it is in</span> <span m="101000">place, so that means that it is fairly efficient in its use of</span> <span m="105000">storage. And it also happens to be very</span> <span m="108000">practical if you tune it a bit. The basic algorithm turns out,</span> <span m="113000">if you just implement that, it's not necessarily that</span> <span m="118000">efficient. But if what you do was then do</span> <span m="122000">the standard kinds of things you do to goose up the runtime of</span> <span m="127000">something, and we'll talk a little about what those things</span> <span m="132000">are, then it can be very, very practical.</span> </p>
<p><span m="136000">So, it uses divide-and-conquer paradigm.</span> </p>
<p><span m="153000">First step is divide. And to do this basically it</span> <span m="160000">does it by partitioning. So, it partitions the input</span> <span m="168000">array into two subarrays around an element we call the pivot --</span> <span m="184000">-- such that elements in the lower subarray are less than or</span> <span m="194000">equal to x, are less than or equal to elements in the upper</span> <span m="205000">subarray. If we draw a picture of the</span> <span m="211000">input array, this partition step basically takes some element x</span> <span m="218000">and everything over here is less than or equal to x after the</span> <span m="225000">partition step and everything over here is greater than or</span> <span m="232000">equal to x. And so now the conquer step is</span> <span m="237000">pretty easy. You just recursively sort the</span> <span m="244000">two subarrays. So, I recursively sort the</span> <span m="250000">elements less than or equal to x, I recursively sort the</span> <span m="259000">elements greater than or equal to x.</span> </p>
<p><span m="264000">And then combine is then just trivial.</span> </p>
<p><span m="272000">Because once I have sorted the things less than or equal to x,</span> <span m="276000">then sorted the things greater than or equal to x,</span> <span m="280000">the whole thing is sorted. So, there is nothing to do</span> <span m="284000">really for the combine. The key step in quicksort is</span> <span m="288000">this partition step. That is the thing that does all</span> <span m="292000">of the work. And so you can view quicksort</span> <span m="295000">of just as recursive partitioning.</span> </p>
<p><span m="297000">That's all it is. Just as mergesort was recursive</span> <span m="306000">merging, quicksort sort of goes the other way around and does</span> <span m="318000">recursive partitioning. The key is the linear time,</span> <span m="328000">by which I mean theta n, partitioning subroutine.</span> </p>
<p><span m="340000">And here are some pseudocode for it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="343000">This is actually slightly different from the book.</span> </p>
<p><span m="347000">The book has one. In fact, there is a nice</span> <span m="351000">problem in the book that has even a different one,</span> <span m="355000">but they are all basically the same idea.</span> </p>
<p><span m="360000">Partition (A, p, q).</span> </p>
<p><span m="361000">And what we are looking at, at this step of the recursion,</span> <span m="366000">is the subarray A from p to q. And basically we pick a pivot,</span> <span m="371000">which is we are going to just pick as the first element of the</span> <span m="377000">array A of p.</span> </p>
<p><span m="386000">And the book, just for your information,</span> <span m="389000">uses A of q. I use A of p.</span> </p>
<p><span m="392000">It doesn't really matter. And then we set an index to p</span> <span m="397000">and then we have a loop.</span> </p>
<p><span m="455000">This is the code. Basically the structure of it</span> <span m="460000">is a for loop with an "if" statement in the middle.</span> </p>
<p><span m="467000">And so the structure of the algorithm of this partitioning</span> <span m="474000">step looks as follows. We set the pivot to be the</span> <span m="480000">first element. Here is p and here is q.</span> </p>
<p><span m="485000">This is going to be our invariant for the loop.</span> </p>
<p><span m="490000">And, at any time during the execution of a loop,</span> <span m="495000">I essentially have some values up to i which are already less</span> <span m="502000">than or equal to x and then some values that end at j minus 1</span> <span m="508000">that are greater than or equal to x.</span> </p>
<p><span m="514000">And then I don't know about the rest.</span> </p>
<p><span m="518000">And so we start out with i equal to p and j equal to p plus</span> <span m="527000">that everything is unknown except for x here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="532000">And then the idea is that it is going to preserve this</span> <span m="538000">invariant. And the way it does it is,</span> <span m="542000">as we go through the loop, it looks at a of j and says is</span> <span m="546000">it greater than or equal to x? Sorry, is it less than or equal</span> <span m="550000">to x? If it is greater than or equal</span> <span m="552000">to x it does nothing, because what can happen?</span> </p>
<p><span m="555000">If this is greater than or equal to x, essentially it just</span> <span m="559000">goes to the next iterational loop which moves this boundary</span> <span m="563000">and the invariant is satisfied. Does everybody see that?</span> </p>
<p><span m="567000">Yeah, OK. But if it is less than or equal</span> <span m="571000">to x, I have got a problem if I want to maintain the invariant</span> <span m="575000">if this next element is less than or equal to x.</span> </p>
<p><span m="578000">And so what it does then is it says oh, let me just move this</span> <span m="583000">boundary and swap this element here, which is greater than or</span> <span m="587000">equal to x, with this one here that is less than or equal to x,</span> <span m="591000">thereby increasing the size of this subarray and then the</span> <span m="595000">invariant is satisfied again. It is a fairly simple</span> <span m="599000">algorithm. And it is actually a very tight</span> <span m="603000">and easy algorithm. That is one reason that this is</span> <span m="608000">such a great piece of code because it is very efficient.</span> </p>
<p><span m="613000">Now, in principle, the running time for this on n</span> <span m="618000">elements is order n.</span> </p>
<p><span m="628000">Because I am basically just going through the n elements and</span> <span m="631000">just doing a constant amount of work and then just a constant</span> <span m="635000">amount of work outside. This is a clever piece of code.</span> </p>
<p><span m="639000">In fact, in principle partition is easy, right?</span> </p>
<p><span m="641000">If I weren't worrying about doing it in place,</span> <span m="644000">it is really a pretty easy thing to do.</span> </p>
<p><span m="647000">I take an element and just compare every other element with</span> <span m="650000">it. I throw one into one bin and</span> <span m="652000">one into the other. That is clearly linear time.</span> </p>
<p><span m="657000">But often what you find is that just because you can do it that</span> <span m="661000">way theoretically doesn't mean that that is going to end up</span> <span m="664000">giving you good code. And this is a nice piece of</span> <span m="668000">code that allows you to do it in place.</span> </p>
<p><span m="670000">And that is one reason why this is a particularly good</span> <span m="674000">algorithm, because the constants are good.</span> </p>
<p><span m="676000">So, yes, when we do asymptotic analysis we tend to ignore the</span> <span m="680000">constants, but when you're actually building code you care</span> <span m="684000">about the constants. But first you care much more</span> <span m="690000">than just about the constants, is whether overall it is going</span> <span m="697000">to be a fast algorithm. Let's go through an example of</span> <span m="703000">this, I guess I will do it over here, just so we get the gist.</span> </p>
<p><span m="710000">Here is a sample array that I have created out of hallcloth.</span> </p>
<p><span m="717000">And here we are going to set x, the pivot, to be 6.</span> </p>
<p><span m="725000">Let's look to see how this algorithm works.</span> </p>
<p><span m="728000">So, i starts out here and j starts out here if we</span> <span m="732000">initialize. And what we do is start</span> <span m="735000">scanning right, essentially that code is</span> <span m="738000">scanning right until it gets something which is less than or</span> <span m="743000">equal to the pivot. It keeps going here until it</span> <span m="747000">finds, j keeps incrementing until it finds something that is</span> <span m="752000">less than or equal to the pivot. And, in that case,</span> <span m="758000">it is the number 5. Then it says we will swap these</span> <span m="764000">two things. And it does that and we get 6,</span> <span m="769000">5, 13, 10, 8, 3, 2, 11.</span> </p>
<p><span m="772000">And meanwhile now i gets incremented and j continues</span> <span m="778000">where it left off. And so now we keep scanning</span> <span m="785000">right until we get to something that is less than or equal to</span> <span m="792000">the pivot. In this case it is 3.</span> </p>
<p><span m="796000">We swap 3 and 5 and get 6, 3, etc.</span> </p>
<p><span m="800000">And now, at this step we increment i, we start j out</span> <span m="807000">here. And in this case,</span> <span m="810000">right off the bat, we have something which is less</span> <span m="815000">than or equal to x, so we swap these two.</span> </p>
<p><span m="819000">I blew it, didn't I? Oops.</span> </p>
<p><span m="822000">What did I do? I swapped the wrong thing,</span> <span m="826000">didn't I, here? Ah-ha.</span> </p>
<p><span m="828000">That is why I am not a computer.</span> </p>
<p><span m="831000">Good. We should have swapped this</span> <span m="834000">guy, right? Swapped i plus 1,</span> <span m="837000">right? This was i.</span> </p>
<p><span m="841000">We swap i plus 1, good.</span> </p>
<p><span m="843000">So, that's all wrong. Let's swap the right things.</span> </p>
<p><span m="849000">Now we have 6, 5, 3, 10, 8,</span> <span m="852000">13, 2, 11. That even corresponds to my</span> <span m="856000">notes for some strange reason. This is i and now this is j.</span> </p>
<p><span m="862000">And now when I look, I immediately have something</span> <span m="868000">that is less than or equal to the pivot.</span> </p>
<p><span m="874000">We swap this and i plus 1, so now we have 6,</span> <span m="881000">5, 3, 2, 8, 13, 10, 11.</span> </p>
<p><span m="885000">And we, at that point, increment i to here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="892000">And we have j now going here and j runs to the end.</span> </p>
<p><span m="903000">And the loop terminates. When the loop terminates there</span> <span m="908000">is one less swap that we do, which is to put our pivot</span> <span m="914000">element in the middle between the two subarrays.</span> </p>
<p><span m="918000">Here we swap this one and this one, and so that gives us then</span> <span m="925000">2, 5, 3, 6, 8, 13, 10, 11.</span> </p>
<p><span m="927000">And this is the pivot. And everything over here is</span> <span m="933000">less than or equal to the pivot. And everything over here is</span> <span m="940000">greater than or equal to the pivot.</span> </p>
<p><span m="956000">OK, so the quicksort routine. Once we have this partition</span> <span m="959000">routine, quicksort is a pretty easy piece of code to write.</span> </p>
<p><span m="978000">I should have said return here i, right?</span> </p>
<p><span m="981000">You have got to return with the pivot.</span> </p>
<p><span m="984000">Here I have got to return i because we want to know where</span> <span m="989000">the pivot element is. Sorry.</span> </p>
<p><span m="993000">I will plug in my code. r gets partition of (A,</span> <span m="1006000">p, q) and then we quicksort (A, p, r-1) and quicksort of (A,</span> <span m="1023000">r+1, q). And that is it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1029000">That's the code. The initial call is quicksort</span> <span m="1037000">of (A, 1, n). Because once we partitioned,</span> <span m="1044000">we just have to quicksort the two portions,</span> <span m="1051000">the left and right portions. Just the boundary case is</span> <span m="1059000">probably worth mentioning for a second.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1061000">If there are zero or one elements, that is basically what</span> <span m="1064000">can possibly happen here, is that I get zero or one</span> <span m="1067000">elements here. Then the point is there is</span> <span m="1069000">nothing to do because the array is sorted, either because it is</span> <span m="1072000">an empty array or because it only has one element.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1076000">One of the tricks to making quicksort go fast,</span> <span m="1079000">as one tunes this, is to, in fact,</span> <span m="1081000">look at having a special purpose sorting routine for</span> <span m="1084000">small numbers of elements. For example,</span> <span m="1087000">if you get down to five elements having some straight</span> <span m="1090000">line piece of code that knows how to sort five elements</span> <span m="1094000">sufficiently as opposed to continuing to go through</span> <span m="1097000">recursion in order to accomplish that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1100000">And there are a variety of other things.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1102000">This is a tail recursive code, and so you can use certain tail</span> <span m="1107000">recursion optimizations. And there are a variety of</span> <span m="1111000">other kinds of optimizations that you can use to make this</span> <span m="1115000">code go fast. So, yeah, you can tune it up a</span> <span m="1117000">bit beyond what is there, but the core of it is this</span> <span m="1120000">efficient partitioning routine.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1133000">That is the algorithm. It turns out that looking at</span> <span m="1138000">how fast it runs is actually a little bit challenging.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1145000">In the analysis, we are going to assume that all</span> <span m="1149000">elements are distinct. It turns out that this</span> <span m="1153000">particular code does not work very well when you have repeated</span> <span m="1159000">elements, but Hoare's original partitioning routine is actually</span> <span m="1165000">more efficient in that case if there are duplicates in what you</span> <span m="1171000">are sorting. And I encourage you to look at</span> <span m="1176000">that. It has a much more complicated</span> <span m="1178000">invariant for partitioning routine, but it does a similar</span> <span m="1182000">kind of thing. It's just a bit more</span> <span m="1185000">complicated. If they weren't all distinct,</span> <span m="1188000">there are things you can do to make them distinct or you can</span> <span m="1192000">just use this code. The easiest thing to do is just</span> <span m="1196000">use Hoare's original code because that works pretty well</span> <span m="1200000">when they are nondistinct. But this is a little bit easier</span> <span m="1207000">to understand. Let's let T(n) be the</span> <span m="1212000">worst-case running time on n elements.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1218000">And so what is the worse-case? What is the worse-case going to</span> <span m="1227000">be for quicksort?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1240000">That's right. If you always pick the pivot</span> <span m="1243000">and everything is greater than or everything is less than,</span> <span m="1247000">you are not going to partition the array very well.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1250000">And when does that happen? What does the original input</span> <span m="1254000">look like that makes that happen?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1257000">If it is already sorted or reverse sorted.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1261000">So, if the input is sorted or reverse sorted.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1265000">That is actually kind of important to understand,</span> <span m="1269000">because it turns out the most common thing to sort is</span> <span m="1274000">something that is already sorted, surprisingly,</span> <span m="1279000">or things that are nearly sorted.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1282000">But often it is just sorted and somebody wants to make sure it</span> <span m="1287000">is sorted. Well, let's just sort it again</span> <span m="1293000">rather than checking to see if it is sorted.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1298000">And, in those cases, one side of the partition of</span> <span m="1303000">each partition has no elements. Then we can write out what the</span> <span m="1310000">recursion is for that. We have T(n).</span> </p>
<p><span m="1314000">If one side has no elements, we are going to have T(0) on</span> <span m="1320000">that side. And on the other side we are</span> <span m="1326000">going to have T(n-1). We are just writing out the</span> <span m="1331000">recursion for this. One side has no elements.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1336000">The other side has n-1 elements.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1339000">And then partitioning and all the bookkeeping and so forth is</span> <span m="1346000">order n. What is T(0)?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1350000">What is T(0)? What is that asymptotically?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1355000">It's a constant, order 1.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1358000">That is just order 1 + T(n-1) + order n.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1364000">Well, the order 1 can be absorbed into the order n,</span> <span m="1370000">so this is really just saying it is T(n-1) + order n.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1379000">And what is that equal to? That is order n^2.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1388000">Why is that order n^2? It is an arithmetic series.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1399000">Actually, just like we got for insertion sort.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1410000">Just like for insertion sort it is an arithmetic series.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1415000">Going through all that work and we have an algorithm called</span> <span m="1422000">quicksort, and it is no faster than insertion sort.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1427000">Nevertheless, I said it was a good algorithm.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1431000">The reason it is a good algorithm is because its average</span> <span m="1437000">case time, as we are going to see, is very good.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1444000">But let's try to understand this a little bit more just so</span> <span m="1449000">that we understand the difference between what is going</span> <span m="1455000">to happen in the average case and what is going to happen in</span> <span m="1460000">the worse-case. Let's draw a recursion tree for</span> <span m="1465000">this for T(n) = T(0) + T(n-1) + and I will make the constant</span> <span m="1471000">explicit for cn. So, we get an intuition of what</span> <span m="1476000">is going on. Some constant times n.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1479000">And then we have T(n) is equal to, and we write it with the</span> <span m="1484000">constant part here, cn, and then T(0) here,</span> <span m="1487000">and then T(n-1) here. Now, I know that all you folks</span> <span m="1491000">are really fast and want to jump immediately to the full-blown</span> <span m="1496000">tree. But, let me tell you,</span> <span m="1499000">my advice is that you spend just a couple of minutes writing</span> <span m="1504000">it out. Since the tree grows</span> <span m="1506000">exponentially, it only costs you a constant</span> <span m="1510000">overhead to write out the small cases and make sure that you</span> <span m="1514000">have got the pattern that you are developing.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1518000">So, I am going to go one more step.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1521000">Here we have T(0) and now this becomes c(n-1) and now we have</span> <span m="1526000">another T(0) over here and T(n-2).</span> </p>
<p><span m="1530000">And we continue that, dot, dot, dot.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1535000">That is all equal to cn with a T(0) here, c(n-1) with a T(0),</span> <span m="1545000">c(n-2), T(0) here, and that goes all the way down</span> <span m="1553000">until we end up with T(1) down here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1561000">What is the height of this tree?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1577000">What is the height of the tree here?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1580000">Yeah, n. Good.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1582000">Because every step we are just decrementing the argument by 1.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1590000">So, the height is n. To analyze this,</span> <span m="1595000">let's first add up everything that is here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1600000">Just so we understand where these things are coming from,</span> <span m="1608000">this is just theta of the summation of k equals 1 to n of</span> <span m="1616000">k, actually of ck. That is what is in there.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1622000">And that is equal to order n^2. That is where our algorithmatic</span> <span m="1628000">series is coming from. So, that is Theta(n^2).</span> </p>
<p><span m="1632000">And then all of these things here are all Theta(1).</span> </p>
<p><span m="1643000">And how many of them are there? There are n Theta(1)'s.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1653000">So, the total amount is T(n) = Theta(n) + Theta(n^2) =</span> <span m="1674000">Theta(n^2). Just to see what the structure</span> <span m="1683000">is in terms of the recursion tree, it is a highly unbalanced</span> <span m="1689000">recursion tree. Now I am going to do something</span> <span m="1694000">that I told you should never do, which is we are going to be do</span> <span m="1700000">a best-case analysis. This is for intuition only.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1705000">And, in general, we don't do best-case analyses.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1712000">It doesn't mean anything, unless we get some intuition</span> <span m="1715000">for it maybe. But basically it means nothing</span> <span m="1718000">mathematically because it's providing no guarantee.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1735000">And so this is intuition only.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1745000">If we are really lucky what happens for partition?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1753000">What is going to be the lucky case?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1766000">Yeah, it splits right in the middle.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1768000">Which is essentially --</span> <span m="1783000">-- n/2 : n/2. It is really (n-1)/2 :</span> <span m="1786000">(n-1)/2, but we're not going to worry about the details because</span> <span m="1791000">we're only doing intuition for the best-case because best-case</span> <span m="1796000">is not what we want. If that happened,</span> <span m="1801000">what is the recurrence I get? Imagine it split it exactly in</span> <span m="1811000">the middle every time, then what happens?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1818000">You get T(n) = 2T(n/2) + order n for partitioning and</span> <span m="1826000">bookkeeping. And what is the solution of</span> <span m="1833000">that recurrence? That is n log n.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1836000">That is the same as the merge sort recurrence.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1842000">It is which case of the master theorem?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1846000">Case 2, right? Because n to the log base 2 of</span> <span m="1851000">2 is n to the 1, it is the same,</span> <span m="1855000">so we tack on the extra log n. Case 2 of the master theorem.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1865000">That is pretty good. That says that in the best-case</span> <span m="1874000">quicksort is going to do well. How about let's suppose the</span> <span m="1884000">split is always let's say 1/10 : 9/10, 1/10n :</span> <span m="1892000">9/10n. In that case,</span> <span m="1895000">are we lucky or are we unlucky?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1912000">I mean, if the split is really skewed, we clearly are going to</span> <span m="1917000">be unlucky, right, because then it's,</span> <span m="1920000">say, 1 to n. If it is really in the middle</span> <span m="1924000">it is n log n. What do you suppose it is if it</span> <span m="1928000">is 1/10 : 9/10? Is that lucky or unlucky?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1931000">We will have a little democracy here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1934000">Who thinks that that is a lucky case?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1937000">It is going to be fast running time.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1940000">And who thinks it is an unlucky case?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1943000">OK, so we have some brave souls.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1946000">And who didn't vote? Oh, come on.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1950000">Come on. It is always better,</span> <span m="1952000">by the way, to say yes or no and be right or wrong,</span> <span m="1955000">because then you have some emotional commitment to it and</span> <span m="1960000">we will remember better, rather than just sitting and</span> <span m="1963000">being quiet. You don't manipulate your own</span> <span m="1967000">emotions well enough to remember things well.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1970000">Those people who voted win over the people who don't vote,</span> <span m="1974000">whether they are right or wrong.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1976000">Well, let's take a look. Here is the recurrence.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1982000">T(n) = T(1/10n) + T(9/10n) + Theta(n).</span> </p>
<p><span m="1987000">And we will assume that this part here is less than or equal</span> <span m="1995000">to some cn in order to analyze it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1999000">We will just do a recursion tree for this and see.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2005000">Here is a recursion tree.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2015000">We have T(n) = cn, T(1/10n), T(9/10n).</span> </p>
<p><span m="2021000">Now we have again cn at the top.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2026000">This gets complicated, right?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2031000">This is 1/10cn. Now, over here we have 1/10.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2040000">And then we are plugging it into the recursion again,</span> <span m="2049000">so we now get T(1/100n) and over here we get T(9/100n).</span> </p>
<p><span m="2060000">And over here we have now 9/10cn.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2066000">And that gives us T(9/100n) again.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2074000">And here we get T(81/100n). And we keep going on.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2088000">That is equal to cn, 1/10cn here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2099000">Down this way we have 1/100cn. And that keeps going down until</span> <span m="2108000">we get to order 1 down here. And over here we have 9/10cn.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2116000">And here, let's see, this is 9/100cn and this is now</span> <span m="2124000">9/100cn and this is 81/100cn. And these things keep going</span> <span m="2132000">down until they get down to order 1.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2136000">But the leaves are not all at uniform depth here,</span> <span m="2141000">right? This side is way further up</span> <span m="2145000">than this side, right?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2147000">Because here we are only going down by 9/10 each time.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2153000">So, in fact, what is the length of this path</span> <span m="2158000">here? What is the length of this path</span> <span m="2162000">down to this, if I take the left most spine?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2175000">Somebody raise there hand. Yeah?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2183000">Log base 10 of n. Because I am basically cutting</span> <span m="2190000">down by a factor of 10 each time.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2193000">And how long does it take me to reduce it to 1?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2195000">That is the definition, if you will,</span> <span m="2198000">of what a log is, log base 10.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2200000">What is this one? What is this path going that</span> <span m="2203000">way?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2213000">Log of n. Log base 10/9 of n. Because we're going down by</span> <span m="2222000">9/10 each time. Once again, essentially the</span> <span m="2225000">definition of n. And everything in between there</span> <span m="2229000">is somewhere between log base 10 of n and log base 10/9 of n.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2234000">So, everything is in between there.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2237000">Now what I can do is do the trick that we did for mergesort</span> <span m="2242000">in looking at what the evaluation of this is by adding</span> <span m="2246000">up what is the cost of the total level.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2251000">That is just cn. What is the cost of the next</span> <span m="2256000">level? cn.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2258000">And what is the cost of the next level?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2263000">cn. Every level we are still doing</span> <span m="2267000">the same amount of work. And we take that all the way</span> <span m="2274000">down. And the last levels --</span> <span m="2280000">Eventually we hit some point where it is not equal to cn</span> <span m="2284000">where we start getting things that are less than or equal to</span> <span m="2289000">cn because some of the leaves start dropping out starting at</span> <span m="2294000">this level. Basically this part is going to</span> <span m="2297000">be log base 10 of n, and then we start getting</span> <span m="2301000">things that are less than or equal to cn, and so forth,</span> <span m="2305000">until finally we get to add it all up.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2310000">T(n) is going to be less than or equal to cn times,</span> <span m="2316000">well, what is the longest that this could possibly be?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2323000">Log base 10/9 of n. Plus we have all of the leaves</span> <span m="2329000">that we have to add in, but all the leaves together add</span> <span m="2336000">up to just order n. All the leaves add up to order</span> <span m="2343000">n, so we have + Theta(n). And so this is how much?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2348000">If I add all of this together, what is this asymptotically?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2354000">That is n log n. So, T(n) is actually bounded by</span> <span m="2358000">n log n. We are lucky.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2361000">Those people who guessed lucky were right.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2365000">A 1/10 : 9/10 split is asymptotically as good as a 50 :</span> <span m="2370000">50 split. And, in fact,</span> <span m="2374000">we can lower bound this by just looking at these things here and</span> <span m="2381000">discover that, in fact, T(n) is lower bounded</span> <span m="2385000">by cn log base 10 of n + order n.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2389000">And so T(n) is lower bounded by also asymptotically n log n.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2395000">So, T(n) is actually Theta(n lg n).</span> </p>
<p><span m="2400000">Now, this is not really proof. I generally recommend that you</span> <span m="2404000">don't do this kind of thing to do a proof.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2407000">This is a good intuition of a recursion tree.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2410000">The way you prove this is what? Substitution method.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2414000">Good. What you do is use this to get</span> <span m="2417000">your guess and then use substitution method to prove</span> <span m="2420000">that your guess is right. It is too easy to make mistakes</span> <span m="2425000">with this method. It is very easy to make</span> <span m="2428000">mistakes. With the substitution method it</span> <span m="2432000">is harder to make mistakes because there is just algebra</span> <span m="2437000">there that you are cranking through.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2440000">It is easier to verify rather than dot, dot,</span> <span m="2443000">dots and trees that you drew improperly and wrote in wrong</span> <span m="2448000">amounts and so forth. OK?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2450000">So, this is n log n. That's pretty good.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2453000">It is order n log n. And we are lucky.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2456000">Now let's try another one. This is all for intuition</span> <span m="2461000">because, I will tell you, by the time we get to the end</span> <span m="2465000">of this class you folks are going to bolting for the door</span> <span m="2470000">because we are going to do some good math today,</span> <span m="2473000">actually. It is actually fun math,</span> <span m="2476000">I think, but it is challenging. If you are not awake,</span> <span m="2480000">you can still sleep now, but I will tell you when to</span> <span m="2483000">wake up. One more bit of intuition.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2486000">Suppose that we alternate steps.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2490000">Suppose we do the partitioning thing.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2493000">And it happens that we start out lucky and then we have a</span> <span m="2498000">partitioning step that is unlucky and then we have a step</span> <span m="2503000">that is lucky and a step that is unlucky and we do that all the</span> <span m="2509000">way down the tree. Suppose we alternate.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2527000">Are we lucky or unlucky if we do that?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2529000">This time I want everybody voting.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2531000">It doesn't matter what your answer is.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2533000">Everybody has to have a stake in the game.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2536000">It is sort of like horseracing. If ever you have watched</span> <span m="2539000">horseracing, it is really boring, but if you put a little</span> <span m="2543000">bit of money down, a little skin in the game</span> <span m="2546000">suddenly it is interesting. The same thing here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2550000">I want everybody to put some skin in the game.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2553000">Who thinks that this is going to be lucky?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2557000">Who thinks it is going to be unlucky?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2560000">OK. Who didn't vote?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2562000">[LAUGHTER] You guys. No skin in the game,</span> <span m="2566000">ha? Let's analyze this so we can</span> <span m="2568000">once again write a recurrence. On the lucky step,</span> <span m="2573000">we will have L(n) be the running time on a lucky step of</span> <span m="2577000">size n. And that is going to be twice.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2582000">While the next step is going to be unlucky.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2587000">It is two unluckies over 2 plus order n.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2590000">That is our lucky step. And then for the unlucky step</span> <span m="2595000">it is essentially going to be L of n minus 1,</span> <span m="2600000">it is going to be lucky on the next step, plus order n.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2605000">That is unlucky. See how I have described this</span> <span m="2610000">behavior with a system now of recurrences that are dependent</span> <span m="2616000">where the boundary cases, once again which are unstated,</span> <span m="2621000">is that the recurrences have a constant solution with constant</span> <span m="2627000">input. Now we just do a little bit of</span> <span m="2630000">algebra using substitution. L(n) is then equal to,</span> <span m="2634000">well, I can just plug in, for U(n/2) plug in the value of</span> <span m="2640000">U(n/2). And that gives me 2[L(n/2-1) +</span> <span m="2646000">Theta(n) + Theta(n)]. See what I did here?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2651000">I simply plugged in, for U(n/2), this recurrence.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2658000">In fact, technically I guess I should have said Theta(n/2) just</span> <span m="2667000">to make this substitution more straightforward.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2675000">It is the same thing, but just to not skip a step.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2681000">That we can now crank through. And that is 2L(n/2 - 1) +,</span> <span m="2689000">and now I have two T(n/2) plus another one, so all of that is</span> <span m="2697000">just order n. And what is the solution to</span> <span m="2704000">that recurrence? n log n.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2707000">Theta(n lg n). Does everybody see that?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2713000">OK? Theta(n lg n).</span> </p>
<p><span m="2715000">This is basically just, once again, master theorem with</span> <span m="2724000">a little bit of jiggering here. That minus one is only going to</span> <span m="2733000">help us, actually, in the solution of the master</span> <span m="2738000">theorem. So, it is order n lg n.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2741000">We are lucky. If we alternate lucky and</span> <span m="2745000">unlucky, we are lucky. How can we insure that we are</span> <span m="2750000">usually lucky? If I have the input already</span> <span m="2755000">sorted, I am going to be unlucky.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2760000">Excuse me? You could randomly arrange the</span> <span m="2763000">elements, that is one way. What is another way?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2767000">That is a perfectly good way, actually.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2770000">In fact, it is a common thing to do.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2773000">Randomly choose the pivot, OK.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2776000">It turns out those are effectively equivalent,</span> <span m="2780000">but we are going to do the randomly choose the pivot</span> <span m="2784000">because it is a little bit easier to analyze.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2790000">But they are effectively equivalent.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2793000">That gives us the algorithm called randomized quicksort.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2806000">And the nice thing about randomized quicksort is that the</span> <span m="2813000">running time is independent of the input ordering.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2820000">Very much for the same reason that if I just scramble the</span> <span m="2824000">input, it would be independent of the input ordering.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2828000">If I randomly scramble the input then it doesn't matter</span> <span m="2832000">what the order of the input was. Whereas, original quicksort has</span> <span m="2837000">some slow cases, input sorted or reverse sorted,</span> <span m="2841000">and some fast cases. In particular,</span> <span m="2844000">it turns out that if it is random it is going to be pretty</span> <span m="2848000">fast. If I actually randomly scramble</span> <span m="2851000">the input or pivot on a random element, it doesn't matter what</span> <span m="2855000">the input was. One way of thinking about this</span> <span m="2858000">is with an adversary. Imagine your adversary,</span> <span m="2860000">you are saying I have a good sorting algorithm and he says I</span> <span m="2864000">have a good sorting algorithm and you're trying to sell to a</span> <span m="2867000">single customer. And the customer says OK,</span> <span m="2870000">you guys come up with benchmarks for each of your</span> <span m="2873000">algorithms. And you get to look at his</span> <span m="2875000">algorithm. Well, you look and you say oh,</span> <span m="2879000">he is using quicksort. I will just give him something</span> <span m="2882000">that is already sorted. That is what you could do to</span> <span m="2886000">him. If you had quicksort,</span> <span m="2888000">he would do the same thing to you.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2890000">So, how can you defeat him? Well, one way is with</span> <span m="2894000">randomization. Big idea in computer science,</span> <span m="2897000">use random numbers. The idea here is if I permute</span> <span m="2900000">the ordering at random, as one suggestion,</span> <span m="2903000">or I pivot at random places, then the input ordering didn't</span> <span m="2908000">matter. And so there is no bad ordering</span> <span m="2912000">that he can provide that is going to make my code run</span> <span m="2916000">slowly. Now, I might get unlucky.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2919000">But that is just unlucky in my use of my random-number</span> <span m="2923000">generator. It is not unlucky with respect</span> <span m="2926000">to what the input was. What the input was doesn't</span> <span m="2930000">matter. Everybody follow that?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2932000">OK. The nice thing about randomized</span> <span m="2935000">quicksort is that it makes no assumptions about the input</span> <span m="2939000">distribution. You don't have to assume that</span> <span m="2945000">all inputs are equally likely because either you can make it</span> <span m="2953000">that way or you pivot in a way that makes that effectively</span> <span m="2960000">whole. And, in particular,</span> <span m="2963000">there is no specific input that can elicit the worst-case</span> <span m="2970000">behavior. The worst-case is determined</span> <span m="2985000">only by a random-number generator.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3000000">And, therefore, since it is only determined by</span> <span m="3003000">a random-number generator, we can essentially bound the</span> <span m="3008000">unluckiness mathematically. We can say what are the odds?</span> </p>
<p><span m="3013000">So, we are going to analyze this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3016000">And this is where you know if you belong in this course or</span> <span m="3021000">not. If you have skipped 6.042 or</span> <span m="3024000">whatever, this is a good place to do the comparison.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3030000">Since it is going to be a little bit, why don't people</span> <span m="3034000">just stand up for a moment and take a stretch break.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3037000">Since this is going to be a nice piece of mathematics we are</span> <span m="3042000">going to do, you are going to want to feel fresh for it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3062000">Stretch break is over.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3070000">Analysis. Good.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3071000">I think we are going to make this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3076000">I am sort of racing. There is a lot of stuff to</span> <span m="3082000">cover today. Good.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3084000">Let's let T(n) now be the random variable for the running</span> <span m="3092000">time assuming --</span> <span m="3106000">Wow. I didn't even write here what</span> <span m="3107000">we did here. So, we are going to pivot on a</span> <span m="3109000">random element.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3119000">That is the basic scheme we are going to do.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3121000">And the way I do that, by the way, is just in the code</span> <span m="3125000">for partition, rather than partitioning on the</span> <span m="3127000">first element, before I do the partition,</span> <span m="3130000">I just swap the first element with some other element in the</span> <span m="3134000">array chosen at random, perhaps itself.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3136000">So, they are all equally likely to be pivoted on.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3139000">And then just run the ordinary partition.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3143000">This is a random variable for running in time assuming,</span> <span m="3147000">we have to make an assumption for doing probability,</span> <span m="3152000">the random numbers are independent.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3161000">So that when I pivot in one place, it is independent of how</span> <span m="3164000">I pivoted in some other place as I am running this algorithm.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3168000">Then, to analyze this, what I am going to do is I want</span> <span m="3172000">to know where we pivoted. For k = 0, 1,</span> <span m="3177000">..., n-1, let's let, for a particular partition,</span> <span m="3188000">the random variable X_k = 1 if partition generates a k :</span> <span m="3201000">n-k-1 split, and 0 otherwise.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3215000">In the partition routine, I am picking a random element</span> <span m="3219000">to pivot on. And X_k is going to be my</span> <span m="3222000">random variable that is 1 if it generates a split that has k</span> <span m="3227000">elements on the left side and n-k-1 elements on the right side</span> <span m="3232000">of the pivot. Some of those,</span> <span m="3234000">too, of course are n-1 because I also have the pivot.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3240000">And 0 otherwise. So, I now have n random</span> <span m="3243000">variables that I have defined associated with a single</span> <span m="3249000">partition where all of them are going to be zero except one of</span> <span m="3255000">them, whichever one happens to occur is going to have the value</span> <span m="3262000">by the way. What is the name of this type</span> <span m="3266000">of random variable?</span> </p>
<p><span m="3277000">Bernoulli. Well, Bernoulli has other</span> <span m="3280000">assumptions. It is an indicator random</span> <span m="3283000">variable. It turns out it is Bernoulli,</span> <span m="3286000">but that's OK. It is an indicator random</span> <span m="3290000">variable. It just takes on the value of</span> <span m="3293000">0, 1. And Bernoulli random variables</span> <span m="3296000">are a particular type of indicator random variable.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3302000">Which it turns out these are. That is an indicator random</span> <span m="3306000">variable. Indicator random variables are</span> <span m="3309000">a good way when you are trying to understand what the sum of a</span> <span m="3314000">bunch of things is. It is a good way to break apart</span> <span m="3318000">your big random variables into smaller ones that can be</span> <span m="3322000">analyzed. Let's just take a look at this</span> <span m="3325000">indicator random variable. What is the expectation of X_k</span> <span m="3330000">equal to?</span> </p>
<p><span m="3342000">In other words, what is the probability that I</span> <span m="3345000">generate a k : n-k-1 split?</span> </p>
<p><span m="3360000">X_k is, let's just write out what that means,</span> <span m="3365000">just to refresh people's memory.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3368000">That is 0 times the probability that X_k equals 0 plus 1 times</span> <span m="3375000">the probability that X_k equals 1, which is equal,</span> <span m="3381000">well, that is all zero. That is just equal to the</span> <span m="3387000">probability that X_k equals 1. And that is a general property</span> <span m="3394000">of indicator random variables, is that their expectation is</span> <span m="3399000">the probability that they are 1. The nice thing about indicator</span> <span m="3405000">random variables is it directly connects the probability to the</span> <span m="3411000">expectation without any other terms going on.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3415000">What is the probability of X_k equals 1?</span> </p>
<p><span m="3418000">1/n. So, all splits are equally</span> <span m="3422000">likely. And I have n elements,</span> <span m="3424000">so each ones has a 1/n chance of being picked as the pivot.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3430000">And, once you pick the pivot, that determines what is on the</span> <span m="3435000">left and the right and so forth. So, it is 1/n.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3439000">Everybody with me so far? More or less?</span> </p>
<p><span m="3443000">OK. As I say, this is going to test</span> <span m="3446000">whether you're in the class. If you go home and you study</span> <span m="3452000">this and you cannot get it, and you have a deficiency in</span> <span m="3457000">your math background in trying to take the course,</span> <span m="3461000">this is a good indication that probably you have taken</span> <span m="3466000">something a little over your head.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3469000">Let's write out what T(n) is equal to here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3480000">T(n) is going to be equal to T(0) + T(n-1) + Theta(n) if we</span> <span m="3491000">get a 0 : n-1 split and is equal to T(1) + T(n-2) + order n if we</span> <span m="3504000">have a 1 : n-2 split.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3515000">And now down here it is going to be T(n-1) + T(0) + Theta(n)</span> <span m="3526000">if we end up with an n-1 : 0 split.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3532000">So, this is our recurrence for T(n).</span> </p>
<p><span m="3540000">And, unfortunately, the recurrence is kind of hairy</span> <span m="3543000">because it has got n cases. And this is,</span> <span m="3546000">once again, where the brilliance of being able to use</span> <span m="3551000">indicator random variables comes in.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3553000">Because we will be able to take this case analysis and reduce it</span> <span m="3558000">to mathematics so we don't have cases using indicator random</span> <span m="3563000">variables. And the way we do that is using</span> <span m="3569000">the following trick of converting the cases into a</span> <span m="3577000">summation.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3595000">Let's just take a look at why these two things are the same.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3600666">The indicator random variable is zero, except if you get the</span> <span m="3606333">particular split. Therefore, this summation is</span> <span m="3610655">going to be zero, except for that k which</span> <span m="3614497">actually appeared in which case it is the value that we say it</span> <span m="3620355">is. See the trick using</span> <span m="3622468">multiplication by 0, 1 variable to handle all the</span> <span m="3627079">cases? I think that is damn clever.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3631404">I think that is damn clever. And this is like the classic</span> <span m="3636213">thing that you do with indicator random variables.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3640421">It's one of the reasons they are a very powerful method.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3645144">Because now we actually have a mathematical expression,</span> <span m="3649781">hairy although it may be, for our recurrence.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3653559">Now, what we are going to analyze is the expected value of</span> <span m="3658454">T(n). That is what we want to do.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3662977">What is the expected value of T(n)?</span> </p>
<p><span m="3666727">To do that, I just write the expected value of T(n) is equal</span> <span m="3673235">to the expected value of this big summation.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3677977">And now we can go ahead and start to evaluate the expected</span> <span m="3684264">value of that summation. Everybody with me?</span> </p>
<p><span m="3690000">Yes? Any questions at this point?</span> </p>
<p><span m="3692486">I see a thumbs up. That's nice to see.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3695360">But I generally believe that what I want to see is no thumbs</span> <span m="3699944">down. It is good to see the thumbs</span> <span m="3702508">up, but that means one person understands, or thinks he</span> <span m="3706704">understands. [LAUGHTER] So,</span> <span m="3708724">this is, I claim, equal to the following.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3711832">Actually, I am going to need a little space here so I am going</span> <span m="3716571">to move the equal sign over a little bit.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3745000">I claim that summation is equal to that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3747702">This expectation is equal to that summation of expectations.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3752000">Why is that? What are the magic words that</span> <span m="3756042">justify this step? Linearity of expectation.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3760281">The expectation of a sum is the sum of the expectations.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3765704">So, that is linearity of expectation.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3769253">I don't need independence for that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3772605">That is just always true for expectation of any random</span> <span m="3777830">variables. The sum of the expectations is</span> <span m="3784591">the expectation of the sum and vice versa.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3790867">Here we did the vice versa. That is equal to now the sum of</span> <span m="3799744">k=0 to n-1 of expectation of X_k [T(k) + T(n-k-1) + Theta(n)].</span> </p>
<p><span m="3816000">Why is that true? What I have done is I've said</span> <span m="3822272">the expectation of the product is the product of the</span> <span m="3829227">expectations. That is because of</span> <span m="3833454">independence. What is independent of what?</span> </p>
<p><span m="3840000">The X_k here, random variable,</span> <span m="3842492">are independent of any of the other partitionings in,</span> <span m="3846962">if you will, the X_k that would exist for</span> <span m="3850401">any of the other recursive calls.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3853151">So, whatever happens in here is independent of what happened</span> <span m="3858223">there. We are actually hiding.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3860716">Since we have a recurrence, we are not partitioning the</span> <span m="3865358">same wage time. We have a different one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3870000">We actually have something going on underneath the</span> <span m="3873168">mathematics you have to pay attention to that the</span> <span m="3876271">mathematics alone isn't really showing, which is that in T(k)</span> <span m="3880150">there is actually a set of random choices that are being</span> <span m="3883706">made, if you will. And so you have to understand</span> <span m="3886745">that those are independent of those, in which case we can</span> <span m="3890366">multiple the probabilities of their expectations.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3893469">Is everybody with me? That is a big one,</span> <span m="3895991">independence of X_k from other random choices.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3900000">That is equal to now, well, first of all,</span> <span m="3904624">this is nice. What is the expectation of X_k?</span> </p>
<p><span m="3909710">1/n. That actually doesn't even</span> <span m="3913179">belong in the summation. We will just pop it outside.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3920000">I get 1/n times the sum of k=0 to n-1 of expectation of T(k) +</span> <span m="3935541">1/n summation k=0 to n-1 of expectation of T(n-k-1) + 1/n</span> <span m="3949808">summation k=0 to n-1 up to Theta(n).</span> </p>
<p><span m="3960000">That is, again, using linearity of expectation</span> <span m="3964838">there this time to split up these pieces and just factoring</span> <span m="3971075">out the expectation of k as being 1/n.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3975053">Everybody with me still? All of this is elementary.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3980430">It is just one of these things that is hard just because there</span> <span m="3986989">are so many steps. And it takes that you have seen</span> <span m="3993174">some of this before. Now the next observation is</span> <span m="3997986">that these two summations are, in fact, identical.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4003003">They are the same summation, just in a different order.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4008532">This is going T(0), T(1), T(2), T(3) up to T(n-1).</span> </p>
<p><span m="4013549">This one is going T(n-1), T(n-2), T(n-3) down to T(0).</span> </p>
<p><span m="4020000">These are, in fact, equal.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4022049">So, therefore, I have two of them.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4039000">And then what is this term equal to?</span> </p>
<p><span m="4057000">What is that one equal to? Theta(n).</span> </p>
<p><span m="4060991">Let's just see why. The summation of 0 :</span> <span m="4065438">n of Theta(n) is Theta(n^2) divided by n.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4070000">Or, if I want to bring the Theta(n) out,</span> <span m="4074447">I have 1 times the summation of k equals1 to n of Theta(1) or of</span> <span m="4084527">you get n, either way of doing it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4087888">This is, in some sense, because the summations have</span> <span m="4092981">identical terms, and this is just algebra.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4097157">Now what we are going to do is do something for technical</span> <span m="4102861">convenience. Because we are going to absorb</span> <span m="4110216">the k=0, 1 terms into the Theta(n) for technical</span> <span m="4118390">convenience.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4126000">We have a recurrence here where I have an order n.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4130432">And, if I look at the cases where k=0 or k=1,</span> <span m="4134412">I know what the expectation is. For 0, 1, the expected cost is</span> <span m="4139929">the worst case cost, which is constant.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4144000">Because I am only solving the problem for a constant size.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4147920">And we know that for any of the boundary cases that our solution</span> <span m="4152252">of recurrence, our assumption is that it is</span> <span m="4155142">constant time. So, I basically can just take</span> <span m="4158100">those two terms out. And all that does it accumulate</span> <span m="4161608">some more constant here in the Theta(n).</span> </p>
<p><span m="4164291">It is going to make the solution of the recurrence a</span> <span m="4167798">little bit easier. And, if I do that,</span> <span m="4173395">I get expectation of T(n) = 2/n summation k=2 to n-1 of</span> <span m="4183584">expectation of T(k) + Theta(n).</span> </p>
<p><span m="4200000">So, all of that work was to derive the recurrence.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4206864">And now we have to solve it. Just to review what we did,</span> <span m="4214570">we started out with a recurrence which was for the</span> <span m="4221434">random variable which involved a case statement.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4229000">We converted that into some mathematics without the case</span> <span m="4233128">statement, just with a product, and then we derived a</span> <span m="4237031">recurrence for the expectation. And now we are in the process</span> <span m="4241535">of trying to solve that recurrence.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4244087">We have done some simplification of the recurrence</span> <span m="4247765">so that we understand what it is that we are going to solve here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4252568">By the way, I don't give things like this on quizzes.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4256472">I do expect you to understand it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4260000">The elements of this you will find on a quiz.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4263120">This is a lot of work to figure out.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4265602">This took smart people to do. Even though it is all</span> <span m="4269148">elementary, but working out something like this at the</span> <span m="4272907">elementary level is still a bit of work even for somebody who is</span> <span m="4277375">knowledgeable in this area. Now we are going to solve that</span> <span m="4283465">last recurrence over there and we are going to prove that the</span> <span m="4290395">expectation of T(n) is less than or equal to (an lg n) for some</span> <span m="4297556">constant a greater than 0. That is going to be what we are</span> <span m="4304139">going to do. And so what technique do you</span> <span m="4308759">think we should use to prove this?</span> </p>
<p><span m="4312571">Does this look like a master method?</span> </p>
<p><span m="4323000">It is nothing like the master method.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4328600">So, when in doubt do substitution.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4333733">It is the grand-daddy of all methods.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4339333">What we will do is solve the base case by simply choosing a</span> <span m="4348355">big enough so that (an lg n) is bigger than the expectation of</span> <span m="4357844">T(n) for sufficiently large small n.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4365000">So, I just pick a to be big enough.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4369212">And this is, by the way, why I wanted to</span> <span m="4374044">exclude 0 and 1 from the recurrence.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4379000">Because, for example, when n=0, log of 0 is,</span> <span m="4383338">it's like dividing by 0, right, you cannot do it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4388181">Log of 1 is 0. So here, even if I restricted</span> <span m="4392519">it to 1, here I would have a 0, and I can't ever pick a big</span> <span m="4398370">enough to dominate those cases. What I do is I just say look,</span> <span m="4404424">I just absorb whatever the cost is into the T(n) for technical</span> <span m="4410577">convenience. And that lets me address it as</span> <span m="4417169">(an lg n) to be big enough to handle the base case.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4424119">So, that is why we made that technical assumption.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4430930">We are going to use a fact which is that the summation of</span> <span m="4438714">k=2 to n-1 of k lg k is less than or equal to 1/2n^2 lg n -</span> <span m="4446776">1/8n^2. I am going to leave that as an</span> <span m="4451242">exercise for you to workout. I think it is an exercise in</span> <span m="4455429">the book, too. I want you to go and evaluate</span> <span m="4458644">this. There are two ways to evaluate</span> <span m="4461261">it. One is by using purely</span> <span m="4463130">summations and facts about summations by splitting the</span> <span m="4467093">summation into two pieces and reconstituting it to prove this</span> <span m="4471579">bound. The other way is to use the</span> <span m="4475338">integral method for solving summations.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4478629">Either way you can prove. The integral method actually</span> <span m="4483220">gets you a tighter bound than this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4486165">This is a basic fact, and you should go off and know</span> <span m="4490582">how to do that. Now let's do substitution.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4506000">The expectation of T(n) is less than or equal to 2/n times the</span> <span m="4518821">summation k=2 to n-1, now we do the substitution of</span> <span m="4529331">ak lg k, the smaller values plus Theta(n).</span> </p>
<p><span m="4539000">I might mentioned, by the way, that the hard part</span> <span m="4542416">of doing this, it is easy to get the bound</span> <span m="4545334">without this term, it is easy to get this bound,</span> <span m="4548679">1/2n^2 lg n, it is harder to get the second</span> <span m="4551669">order term. It turns out you need the</span> <span m="4554231">second order term in order to do what we are going to do.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4559000">You have to be able to subtract a quadratic amount of the n^2 lg</span> <span m="4565621">n in order to make this proof work.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4569195">And that is the trickier part in evaluating that summation.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4575291">So, we get this. That is less than or equal to?</span> </p>
<p><span m="4580126">Well, I happen to know how much this is by using that formula.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4586537">I use my fact and get 2a/n (1/2n^2 lg n - 1/8n^2) +</span> <span m="4591792">Theta(n). Did I do something wrong?</span> </p>
<p><span m="4603558">There we go. Very good.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4611970">That is equal to - If I multiply this first part</span> <span m="4625272">through that is an lg n. And now, so I don't make a</span> <span m="4634363">mistake, I want to express this as my desired,</span> <span m="4642545">this is what I want it to be, minus a residual.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4652000">I am going to write the residual as this part.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4658702">And so, the way to write that is, that is going to be minus.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4667489">And then it is going to be this term here, which is going to be</span> <span m="4676723">an/4 - Theta(n).</span> </p>
<p><span m="4685000">And that is going to be less than or equal to an lg n if this</span> <span m="4692309">part is positive. And I can make that part</span> <span m="4697304">positive by picking a big enough such that an/4 dominates the</span> <span m="4704614">constant in the Theta(n) here. Whatever the constant is here,</span> <span m="4714590">I can find an a that is big enough so that this term makes</span> <span m="4725211">this part positive. If a is big enough so that an/4</span> <span m="4734527">dominates Theta(n). And so the running time of</span> <span m="4741217">randomized quicksort is order n lg n.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4744288">That is what we just proved, the expected running time is</span> <span m="4749064">order n lg n. Now, in practice,</span> <span m="4751623">quicksort is a great algorithm. It is typically three or more</span> <span m="4756741">times faster than mergesort. It doesn't give you the strong</span> <span m="4761688">guarantee necessarily of mergesort and being worst-case n</span> <span m="4766464">lg n. But in practice,</span> <span m="4769245">if you use randomized quicksort, it is generally as</span> <span m="4773136">much as three times faster. It does require code tuning in</span> <span m="4777573">order to get it up to be that fast.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4780219">You do have to go and coarsen the base cases and do some other</span> <span m="4784966">tricks there, but most good sorting</span> <span m="4787613">algorithms that you will find are based on quicksort.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4791660">Also one of the other reasons it works well is because it</span> <span m="4796018">tends to work well with caches in virtual memory.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4801000">We are not really talking much about caching models and so</span> <span m="4805431">forth, big topic these days in algorithms, but it does work</span> <span m="4809941">very well with caches in virtual memory.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4812973">It is another reason that this is a good algorithm to use.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4817405">Good recitation, by the way, on Friday.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4820359">We are going to see another n log n time algorithm,</span> <span m="4824247">a very important one in recitation on Friday.</span> </p>
