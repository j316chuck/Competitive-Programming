<p><span m="0">So to finish up,</span> <span m="9000">Hashing.</span> </p>
<p><span m="15000">Today we're going to do some amazing stuff with hashing.</span> </p>
<p><span m="19000">And, really, this is such neat stuff,</span> <span m="21000">it's amazing. We're going to start by</span> <span m="24000">addressing a fundamental weakness of hashing.</span> </p>
<p><span m="34000">And that is that for any choice of hash function</span> <span m="49000">There exists a bad set of keys that all hash to the same slot.</span> </p>
<p><span m="69000">OK. So you pick a hash function.</span> </p>
<p><span m="71000">We looked at some that seem to work well in practice,</span> <span m="75000">that are easy to put into your code.</span> </p>
<p><span m="78000">But whichever one you pick, there's always some bad set of</span> <span m="83000">keys. So you can imagine,</span> <span m="85000">just to drive this point home a little bit.</span> </p>
<p><span m="90000">Imagine that you're building a compiler for a customer and you</span> <span m="95000">have a symbol table in your compiler and one of the things</span> <span m="100000">that the customer is demanding is that compilations go fast.</span> </p>
<p><span m="106000">They don't want to sit around waiting for compilations.</span> </p>
<p><span m="110000">And you have a competitor who's also building a compiler and</span> <span m="116000">they're going to test the compiler, both of your compilers</span> <span m="121000">and sort of have a run-off. And one of the things in the</span> <span m="127000">test that they're going to allow you to do is not only will the</span> <span m="132000">customer run his own benchmarks, but he'll let you make up</span> <span m="136000">benchmarks for the other program, for your competitor.</span> </p>
<p><span m="140000">And your competitor gets to make up benchmarks for you.</span> </p>
<p><span m="144000">So and not only that, but you're actually sharing</span> <span m="148000">code. So you get to look at what the</span> <span m="152000">competitor is actually doing and what hash function they're</span> <span m="157000">actually using. So it's pretty clear that in</span> <span m="160000">this circumstance, you have an adversary who is</span> <span m="164000">going to look at whatever hash function you have and figure out</span> <span m="169000">OK, what's a set of variable names and so forth that are</span> <span m="173000">going to all hash to the same slot so that essentially you're</span> <span m="178000">just chasing through a linked list whenever it comes to</span> <span m="183000">looking something up. Slowing down your program</span> <span m="187000">enormously compared to if in fact they got distributed nicely</span> <span m="192000">across the hash table which is, what after all,</span> <span m="195000">you have a hash table in there to do in the first place.</span> </p>
<p><span m="199000">And so the question is, how do you defeat this</span> <span m="202000">adversary? And the answer is one word.</span> </p>
<p><span m="211000">One word. How do you achieve?</span> </p>
<p><span m="213000">How do you defeat any adversary in this class?</span> </p>
<p><span m="217000">Randomness. OK.</span> </p>
<p><span m="218000">Randomness. OK.</span> </p>
<p><span m="219000">You make it so that he can't guess.</span> </p>
<p><span m="222000">And the idea is that you choose a hash function at random.</span> </p>
<p><span m="227000">Independent. So he can look at the code,</span> <span m="230000">but when it actually runs, it's going to use a random hash</span> <span m="235000">function that he has no way of predicting what the hash</span> <span m="240000">function is that will actually be used.</span> </p>
<p><span m="245000">OK. So that's the game and that way</span> <span m="247000">he can provide an input, but he can't provide an input</span> <span m="251000">that's guaranteed to force you to run slowly.</span> </p>
<p><span m="255000">You might get unlucky in your choice of hash function,</span> <span m="259000">but it's not going to be because of the adversary.</span> </p>
<p><span m="263000">So the idea is to choose a hash function --</span> <span m="274000">-- at random, independently from the keys</span> <span m="278000">that you're, that are going to be fed to it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="282000">So even if your adversary can see your code,</span> <span m="287000">he can't tell which hash function is going to be actually</span> <span m="293000">used at run time. Doesn't get to see the output</span> <span m="298000">of the random numbers. And so it turns out you can</span> <span m="304000">make this scheme work and the name of the scheme is universal</span> <span m="311000">hashing, OK, is one way of making this scheme work.</span> </p>
<p><span m="322000">So let's do some math. So let U be a universe of keys.</span> </p>
<p><span m="334000">And let H be a finite collection --</span> <span m="348000">-- of hash functions --</span> <span m="356000">-- mapping U to what are going to be the slots in our hash</span> <span m="364000">table. OK.</span> </p>
<p><span m="366000">So we just have H as some finite collection.</span> </p>
<p><span m="371000">We say that H is universal --</span> <span m="382000">-- if for all pairs of the keys, distinct keys --</span> <span m="396000">-- so the keys are distinct, the following is true.</span> </p>
<p><span m="423000">So if the set of keys, if for any pair of keys I pick,</span> <span m="428000">the number of hash functions that hash those two keys to the</span> <span m="435000">same place is a one over m fraction of the total set of</span> <span m="441000">keys. So let m just,</span> <span m="443000">so to view that, another way of viewing that is</span> <span m="448000">if H is chosen randomly --</span> <span m="459000">-- from the set of keys H, the probability of collision</span> <span m="471000">between x and y is what?</span> </p>
<p><span m="492000">What's the probability if the fraction of hash functions,</span> <span m="497000">OK, if the number of hash functions is H over m,</span> <span m="502000">what's the probability of a collision between x and y?</span> </p>
<p><span m="507000">If I pick a hash function at random.</span> </p>
<p><span m="512000">So I pick a hash function at random, what's the odds they</span> <span m="519000">collide? One over m.</span> </p>
<p><span m="522000">Now let's draw a picture for that, help people see that</span> <span m="529000">that's in fact the case. So imagine this is our set of</span> <span m="536000">all hash functions. OK.</span> </p>
<p><span m="540000">And then if I pick a particular x and y, let's say that this is</span> <span m="548000">the set of hash functions such that H of x is equal to H of y.</span> </p>
<p><span m="556000">And so what we're saying is that the cardinality of that set</span> <span m="563000">is one over m times the cardinality of H.</span> </p>
<p><span m="570000">So if I throw a dart and pick one hash function at random,</span> <span m="573000">the odds are one in m that the hash function falls into this</span> <span m="577000">particular set. And of course,</span> <span m="579000">this has to be true of every x and y that I can pick.</span> </p>
<p><span m="583000">Of course, it will be a different set,</span> <span m="585000">a different x and y will somehow map the hash functions</span> <span m="589000">differently, but the odds that for any x and y that I pick,</span> <span m="592000">the odds that if I have a random hash function,</span> <span m="595000">it hashes it to the same place, is one over m.</span> </p>
<p><span m="600000">Now this is a little bit hard sometimes for people to get</span> <span m="603000">their head around because we're used to thinking of perhaps</span> <span m="607000">picking keys at random or something.</span> </p>
<p><span m="609000">OK, that's not what's going on here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="611000">We're picking hash functions at random.</span> </p>
<p><span m="614000">So our probability space is defined over the hash functions,</span> <span m="618000">not over the keys. And this has to be true now for</span> <span m="621000">any particular two keys that I pick that are distinct.</span> </p>
<p><span m="624000">That the places that they hash, this set of hash functions,</span> <span m="628000">I mean this is like a marvelous property if you think about it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="634000">OK, that you can actually find ones where no matter what two</span> <span m="639000">elements I pick, the odds are exactly one in m</span> <span m="643000">that a random hash function from this set is going to hash them</span> <span m="648000">to the same place. So very neat.</span> </p>
<p><span m="651000">Very, very neat property and we'll see the mathematics</span> <span m="656000">associated with this is very cool.</span> </p>
<p><span m="660000">So our theorem is that if we choose h randomly from the set</span> <span m="674000">of hash functions H, and then we suppose we're</span> <span m="685000">hashing n keys into m slots in Table T --</span> <span m="704000">-- then for given key x --</span> <span m="712000">-- the expected number of collisions with x --</span> <span m="723000">-- is less than n over m. And who remembers what we call</span> <span m="732000">n over m? Alpha, which is the,</span> <span m="736000">what's the term that we use there?</span> </p>
<p><span m="742000">Load factor. The load factor of the table.</span> </p>
<p><span m="750000">OK, load factor alpha. So the average number of keys</span> <span m="756000">per slot is the load factor of the table.</span> </p>
<p><span m="762000">So we're saying, so what is this theorem saying?</span> </p>
<p><span m="768000">It's saying that in fact, if we have one of these</span> <span m="775000">universal sets of hash functions, then things perform</span> <span m="782000">exactly the way we want them to. Things get distributed evenly.</span> </p>
<p><span m="790000">The number of things that are going to collide with any</span> <span m="795000">particular key that I pick is going to be n over m.</span> </p>
<p><span m="799000">So that's a really good property to have.</span> </p>
<p><span m="802000">Now I haven't shown you, the construction of U is going,</span> <span m="807000">sorry, of the set of hash functions H, that that</span> <span m="811000">construction will take us a little bit of effort.</span> </p>
<p><span m="816000">But first I want to show you why this is such a great</span> <span m="819000">property. Basically it's this theorem.</span> </p>
<p><span m="822000">So let's prove this theorem. So any questions about what the</span> <span m="826000">statement of the theorem is? So we're going to go actually</span> <span m="830000">kind of fast today. We've got a lot of good stuff</span> <span m="834000">today. So I want to make sure people</span> <span m="837000">are onboard as we go through. So if there are any questions,</span> <span m="843000">make sure, you know, statement of theorem of</span> <span m="847000">whatever, best to get them out early so that you're not</span> <span m="853000">confused later on when the going gets a little more exciting.</span> </p>
<p><span m="859000">OK? OK, good.</span> </p>
<p><span m="861000">So to prove this, let's let C sub x be the random</span> <span m="866000">variable denoting the total number of collisions --</span> <span m="878000">-- of keys in T with x. So this is a total number and</span> <span m="884000">one of the techniques that you use a lot in probabilistic</span> <span m="891000">analysis of randomized algorithms is recognizing that C</span> <span m="897000">of x is in fact a sum of indicator random variables.</span> </p>
<p><span m="905000">If you can decompose things into indicator random variables,</span> <span m="911000">the analysis goes much more easily than if you're left with</span> <span m="917000">aggregate variables. So here we're going to let our</span> <span m="922000">indicator random variable be little c of x.,</span> <span m="927000">which is going to be one if h of x equals h of y and 0</span> <span m="932000">otherwise.</span> </p>
<p><span m="940000">And so we can note two things. First, what is the expectation</span> <span m="949000">of C of x..</span> </p>
<p><span m="957000">OK, if I have a process which is picking a hash function at</span> <span m="960000">random, what's the expectation of C of x.?</span> </p>
<p><span m="964000">One over m. Because that's basically this</span> <span m="967000">definition here. Now in other words I pick a</span> <span m="971000">hash function at random, what's the odds that the hash</span> <span m="976000">is the same? It's one over m.</span> </p>
<p><span m="979000">And then the other thing is, and the reason we pick this</span> <span m="984000">thing is that I can express capital C sub x,</span> <span m="988000">the random variable denoting the total number of collisions</span> <span m="993000">as being just the sum over all the keys in the table except x</span> <span m="999000">of C of x.. So for each one that would</span> <span m="1006000">cause me a collision, with x, I add one and if it</span> <span m="1013000">wouldn't cause me a collision, I add 0.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1020000">And that adds up all of the collisions that I would have in</span> <span m="1026000">the table with x.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1037000">Is there any questions so far? Because this is the set-up.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1040000">The set-up in most of these things, the set-up is where most</span> <span m="1044000">students make mistakes and most practicing researchers make</span> <span m="1047000">mistakes as well, let me tell you.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1050000">And then once you get the set-up right,</span> <span m="1052000">then working out the math is fine, but it's often that set-up</span> <span m="1056000">of how do you actually translate the situation into the math.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1060000">That's the hard part. Once you get that right,</span> <span m="1063000">well, then, algebra, we can all do algebra.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1066000">Of course, we can also all make mistakes doing algebra,</span> <span m="1069000">but at least those mistakes are much more easy to check than the</span> <span m="1073000">one that does the translation. So I want to make sure people</span> <span m="1077000">are sort of understanding of how that's set up.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1080000">So now we just have to use our math skills.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1085000">So the expectation then of the number of collisions is the</span> <span m="1092000">expectation of C sub x and that's just the expectation of</span> <span m="1098000">just plugging the sum of y and T minus the element x of c_xy.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1106000">So that's just definition. And that's equal to the sum of</span> <span m="1113000">y and T minus x of expectation of c_xy.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1119000">So why is that? Yeah, that's linearity.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1132000">Linearity of expectation, doesn't require independence.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1136000">It's true of all random variables.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1140000">And that's equal to, and now the math gets easier.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1147000">So what is that? One over m.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1150000">That makes the summation easy to evaluate.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1156000">That's just n minus one over m.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1170000">So fairly simple analysis and shows you why we would love to</span> <span m="1175000">have one of these sets of universal hash functions because</span> <span m="1181000">if you have them, then they behave exactly the</span> <span m="1185000">way you would want it to behave. And you defeat your adversary</span> <span m="1191000">by just picking up the hash function at random.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1195000">There's nothing he can do. Or she.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1200000">OK, any questions about that proof?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1202000">OK, now we get into the fun math.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1204000">Constructing one of these babies.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1207000">OK.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1220000">This is not the only construction.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1223000">This is a construction of a classic universal hash function.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1231000">And there are other constructions in the literature</span> <span m="1237000">and I think there's one on the practice quiz.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1242000">So let's see. So this one works when m is</span> <span m="1247000">prime. So it works when the set of</span> <span m="1251000">slots is a prime number. Number of slots is a prime</span> <span m="1257000">number. So the idea here is we're going</span> <span m="1265000">to decompose any key k in our universe into r plus 1 digits.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1276000">So k, we're going to look at as being a k 0, k one,</span> <span m="1285000">k_r where 0 is less than or equal to k sub I,</span> <span m="1293000">is less than or equal to m minus one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1301000">So the idea is in some sense we're looking at what the</span> <span m="1307000">representation would be of k base m.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1312000">So if it were base two, it would be just one bit at a</span> <span m="1318000">time. These would just be the bits.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1321000">I'm not going to do base two. We're going to do base min</span> <span m="1325000">general and so each of these represents one of the digits.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1329000">And the way I've done it is I've done low order digit first.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1333000">It actually doesn't matter. We're not actually going to</span> <span m="1336000">care really about what the order is, but basically we're just</span> <span m="1340000">looking at busting it into a twofold represented by each of</span> <span m="1344000">those digits. So one algorithm for computing</span> <span m="1347000">this out of k is take the remainder mod m.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1351000">That's the low order one. OK, take what's left.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1354000">Take the remainder of that mod m.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1357000">Take whatever's left, etc.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1359000">So you're familiar with the conversion to a base</span> <span m="1362000">representation. That's exactly how we're</span> <span m="1366000">getting this representation. So we treat,</span> <span m="1369000">this is just a question of taking the data that we've got</span> <span m="1373000">and treating it as an r plus one base m number.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1377000">And now we invoke our randomized strategy.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1382000">The randomized strategy is going to be able to have a class</span> <span m="1385000">of hash functions that's dependent essentially on random</span> <span m="1389000">numbers. And the random numbers we're</span> <span m="1391000">going to pick is we're going to pick an a at random --</span> <span m="1408000">-- which we're also going to look at as a base mnumber.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1413000">For each a_i is chosen randomly --</span> <span m="1429000">-- from --</span> <span m="1435000">-- 0 to m minus one. So one of our,</span> <span m="1438000">it's a random if you will, it's a random base mdigit.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1443000">Random base m digit. So each one of these is picked</span> <span m="1446000">at random. And for each one we,</span> <span m="1449000">possible value of A, we're going to get a different</span> <span m="1453000">hash function. So we're going to index our</span> <span m="1456000">hash functions by this random number.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1459000">So this is where the randomness is going to come in.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1463000">Everybody with me? And here's the hash function.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1496000">So what we do is we dot product this vector with this vector and</span> <span m="1506000">take the result, mod m.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1511000">So each digit of k of our key gets multiplied by a random</span> <span m="1518000">other digit. We add all those up and we take</span> <span m="1525000">that mod m. So that's a dot product</span> <span m="1529000">operator. And this is what we're going to</span> <span m="1534000">show is universal, that this set of h sub a,</span> <span m="1537000">where I look over that whole set.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1539000">So one of the things we need to know is how big is the set of</span> <span m="1544000">hash functions here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1559000">So how big is this set of hash functions?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1561000">How many different hash functions do I have in this set?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1584000">It's basic 6.042 material. It's basically how many vectors</span> <span m="1591000">of length r plus one where each element of the vector is a</span> <span m="1598000">number of 0 to m minus one, has m different values.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1605000">So how many? m minus one to the r.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1610000">No. Close.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1611000">It's up there. It's a big number.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1616000">m to the r plus one. Good.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1621000">It's m, so the size of H is equal to m to the r plus one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1626000">So we're going to want to remember that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1630000">OK, so let's just understand why that is.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1633000">I have m choices for the first value of A.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1637000">m for the second, etc.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1639000">m for the r th. And since there are plus one</span> <span m="1643000">things here, for each choice here, I have this many same</span> <span m="1648000">number of choices here, so it's a product.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1654000">OK, so this is the product rule in counting.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1659000">So if you haven't reviewed your 6.042 notes for counting,</span> <span m="1665000">this is going to be a good idea to go back and review that</span> <span m="1672000">because we're doing stuff of that nature.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1677000">This is just the product rule. Good.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1681000">So then the theorem we want to prove is that H is universal.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1690000">And this is going to involve a little bit of number theory,</span> <span m="1694000">so it gets kind of interesting. And it's a non-trivial proof,</span> <span m="1699000">so this is where if there's any questions as I'm going along,</span> <span m="1703000">please ask because the argument is not as simple as other</span> <span m="1708000">arguments we've seen so far. OK, not the ones we've seen so</span> <span m="1713000">far have been simple, but this is definitely a more</span> <span m="1718000">involved mathematical argument. So here's a proof.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1723000">So let's let, so we have two keys.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1726000">What are we trying to show if it's universal,</span> <span m="1730000">that if I pick any two keys, the number of hash functions</span> <span m="1735000">for which they hash to the same thing is the size of set of hash</span> <span m="1741000">functions divided by m. OK, so I'm going to look at two</span> <span m="1748000">keys. So let's pick two keys</span> <span m="1751000">arbitrarily. So x, and we'll decompose it</span> <span m="1756000">into our base r representation and y, y_0, y_1 --</span> <span m="1773000">So these are two distinct keys. So if these are two distinct</span> <span m="1779000">keys, so they're different, then this base representation</span> <span m="1785000">has the property that they've got to differ somewhere.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1790000">Right? OK, they differ in at least one</span> <span m="1794000">digit.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1808000">OK, and this is where most people get lost because I'm</span> <span m="1812000">going to make a simplification. They could differ in any one of</span> <span m="1816000">these digits. I'm going to say they differ in</span> <span m="1820000">position 0 because it doesn't matter which one I do,</span> <span m="1824000">the math is the same, but it'll make it so that if I</span> <span m="1828000">pick some said they differ in some position i,</span> <span m="1831000">I would have to be taking summations as you'll see over</span> <span m="1835000">the elements that are not i, and that's complicated.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1841000">If I do it in position 0, then I can just sum for the</span> <span m="1844000">rest of them. So the math is going to be</span> <span m="1846000">identical if I were to do it for any position because it's</span> <span m="1850000">symmetric. All the digits are symmetric.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1852000">So let's say they differ in position 0, but the same</span> <span m="1856000">argument is going to be true if they differed in some other</span> <span m="1859000">position. So let's say,</span> <span m="1862000">so we're saying without loss of generality.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1865000">So that's without loss of generality.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1868000">Position 0. Because all the positions are</span> <span m="1872000">symmetric here. And so, now we need to ask the</span> <span m="1876000">question for how many --</span> <span m="1884000">-- hash functions in our universal, purportedly universal</span> <span m="1890000">set do x and y collide?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1899000">OK, we've got to count them up. So how often do they collide?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1902000">This is where we're going to pull out some heavy duty number</span> <span m="1906000">theory. So we must have,</span> <span m="1908000">if they collide --</span> <span m="1916000">-- that h sub a of x is equal to h sub a of y.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1923000">That's what it means for them to collide.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1929000">So that implies that the sum of i equal 0 to r of a sub i x sub</span> <span m="1940000">i is equal to the sum of i equals 0 to r of a sub i y sub i</span> <span m="1950000">mod m. Actually this is congruent mod</span> <span m="1955000">m. So congruence for those people</span> <span m="1958000">who haven't seen much number theory, is basically the way of</span> <span m="1963000">essentially, rather than having to say mod everywhere in here</span> <span m="1968000">and mod everywhere in here, we just at the end say OK,</span> <span m="1972000">do a mod at the end. Everything is being done mod,</span> <span m="1976000">module m. And then typically we use a</span> <span m="1979000">congruence sign. OK, there's a more mathematical</span> <span m="1986000">definition but this will work for us engineers.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1993000">OK, so everybody with me so far?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1998000">This is just applying the definition.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2003000">So that implies that the sum of i equals 0 to r of a i x i minus</span> <span m="2012000">y i is congruent to zeros mod m. OK, just threw it on the other</span> <span m="2021000">side and applied the distributive law.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2025000">Now what I'm going to do is pull out the 0-th position</span> <span m="2029000">because that's the one that I care about.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2033000">And this is where it saves me on the math, compared to if I</span> <span m="2038000">didn't say that it was 0. I'd have to pull out x_i.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2043000">It wouldn't matter, but it just would make the math</span> <span m="2045000">a little bit cruftier</span> <span m="2063000">OK, so now we've just pulled out one term.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2070000">That implies that a_0 x_0 minus y_0 is congruent to minus --</span> <span m="2094000">-- mod m. Now remember that when I have a</span> <span m="2098000">minus number mod m, I just map it into whatever,</span> <span m="2102000">into that range from 0 to m minus one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2107000">So for example, minus five mod seven is two.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2112000">So if any of these things are negative, we simply translate</span> <span m="2119000">them into by adding multiples of mbecause adding multiples of m</span> <span m="2127000">doesn't affect the congruence.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2139000">OK. And now for the next step,</span> <span m="2141000">we need to use a number theory fact.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2144000">So let's pull out our number theory --</span> <span m="2157000">-- textbook and take a little digression</span> <span m="2170000">So this comes from the theory of finite fields.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2174000">So for people who are knowledgeable,</span> <span m="2177000">that's where you're plugging your knowledge in.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2181000">If you're not knowledgeable, this is a great area of math to</span> <span m="2186000">learn about. So here's the fact.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2190000">So let m be prime. Then for any z,</span> <span m="2194000">little z element of z sub m, and z sub m is the integers mod</span> <span m="2201000">m. So this is essentially numbers</span> <span m="2206000">from 0 to m minus one with all the operations,</span> <span m="2211000">times, minus, plus, etc., defined on that</span> <span m="2217000">such that if you end up outside of the range of 0 to m minus</span> <span m="2224000">one, you re-normalize by subtracting or adding multiples</span> <span m="2231000">of m to get back within the range from 0 to m minus one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2241000">So it's the standard thing of just doing things module m.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2250000">So for any z such that z is not congruent to 0,</span> <span m="2258000">there exists a unique z inverse in z sub m, such that if I</span> <span m="2267000">multiply z times the inverse, it produces something congruent</span> <span m="2277000">to one mod m. So for any number it says,</span> <span m="2284000">I can find another number that when multiplied by it gives me</span> <span m="2291000">one. So let's just do an example for</span> <span m="2295000">m equals seven. So here we have,</span> <span m="2298000">we'll make a little table. So z is not equal to 0,</span> <span m="2304000">so I just write down the other numbers.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2309000">And let's figure out what z inverse is.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2315000">So what's the inverse of one? What number when multiplied by</span> <span m="2321000">one gives me one? One.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2323000">Good. How about two?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2325000">What number when I multiply it by two gives me one?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2331000">Four. Because two times four is eight</span> <span m="2335000">and eight is congruent to one mod seven.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2341000">So I've re-normalized it. What about three?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2352000">Five. Good.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2353000">Five. Three times five is 15.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2356000">That's congruent to one mod seven because 15 divided by</span> <span m="2362000">seven is two remainder of one. So that's the key thing.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2368000">What about four? Two.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2372000">Five? Three. And six.</span> </p>
<p></p>
<p><span m="2383000">Yeah. Six. Yeah, six it turns out. OK, six times six is 36.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2388000">OK, mod seven. Basically subtract off the 35,</span> <span m="2392000">gives m one. So people have observed some</span> <span m="2396000">interesting facts that if one number's an inverse of another,</span> <span m="2402000">then that other is an inverse of the one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2408000">So that's actually one of these things that you prove when you</span> <span m="2412000">do group theory and field theory and so forth.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2416000">There are all sorts of other great properties of this kind of</span> <span m="2421000">math. But the main thing is,</span> <span m="2423000">and this turns out not to be true if m is not a prime.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2427000">So can somebody think of, imagine we're doing something</span> <span m="2431000">mod 10. Can somebody think of a number</span> <span m="2436000">that doesn't have an inverse mod 10?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2439000">Yeah. Two.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2440000">Another one is five. OK, it turns out the divisors</span> <span m="2445000">in fact actually, more generally,</span> <span m="2449000">something that is not relatively prime,</span> <span m="2453000">meaning that it has no common factors, the GCD is not one</span> <span m="2458000">between that number and the modulus.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2464000">OK, those numbers do not have an inverse mod m.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2468000">OK, but if it's prime, every number is relatively</span> <span m="2473000">prime to the modulus. And that's the property that</span> <span m="2477000">we're taking advantage of. So this is our fact and so,</span> <span m="2482000">in this case what I'm after is I want to divide by x_0 minus</span> <span m="2488000">y_0. That's what I want to do at</span> <span m="2491000">this point. But I can't do that if x_0,</span> <span m="2494000">first of all, if m isn't prime,</span> <span m="2496000">I can't necessarily do that. I might be able to,</span> <span m="2500000">but I can't necessarily. But if m is prime,</span> <span m="2503000">I can definitely divide by x_0 minus y_0.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2506000">I can find that inverse. And the other thing I have to</span> <span m="2509000">do is make sure x_0 minus y_0 is not 0.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2512000">OK, it would be 0 if these two were equal, but our supposition</span> <span m="2517000">was they weren't equal. And once again,</span> <span m="2521000">just bringing it back to the without loss of generality,</span> <span m="2525000">if it were some other position that we were off,</span> <span m="2528000">I would be doing exactly the same thing with that position.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2533000">So now we're going to be able to divide.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2536000">So we continue with our --</span> <span m="2544000">-- continue with our proof. So since x_0 is not equal to</span> <span m="2553000">y_0, there exists an inverse for x_0 minus y_0.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2562000">And that implies, just continue on from over</span> <span m="2568000">there, that a_0 is congruent therefore to minus the sum of i</span> <span m="2576000">equal one to r of a_i, x_i minus y_i times x_0 minus</span> <span m="2584000">y_0 inverse. So let's just go back to the</span> <span m="2590000">beginning of our proof and see what we've derived.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2595000">If we're saying we have two distinct keys,</span> <span m="2599000">and we've picked all of these a_i randomly,</span> <span m="2604000">and we're saying that these two distinct keys hash to the same</span> <span m="2610000">place. If they hash to the same place,</span> <span m="2614000">it says that a_0 essentially had to have a particular value</span> <span m="2621000">as a function of the other a_i. Because in other words,</span> <span m="2627000">once I've picked each of these a_i from one to r,</span> <span m="2631000">if I did them in that order, for example,</span> <span m="2634000">then I don't have a choice for how I pick a_0 to make it</span> <span m="2638000">collide. Exactly one value allows it to</span> <span m="2640000">collide, namely the value of a_0 given by this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2645000">If I picked a different value of a_0, they wouldn't collide.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2650000">So let m write that down. Thus, while you think about it</span> <span m="2712000">So for any choice of these a_i, there's exactly one of the</span> <span m="2718000">impossible choices of a_0 that cause a collision.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2724000">And for all the other choices I might make of a_0,</span> <span m="2729000">there's n collision. So essentially I don't have,</span> <span m="2736000">if they're going to collide, I've reduced essentially the</span> <span m="2742000">number of degrees of freedom of my randomness by a factor of m.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2749000">So if I count up the number of h_a's that cause x and y to</span> <span m="2755000">collide, that's equal to, well, there's m choices,</span> <span m="2761000">just using the product rule again.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2766000">There's m choices for a_1 times m choices for a_2,</span> <span m="2773000">up to m choices for a_r and then only one choice for a_0.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2781000">So this is choices for a_1, a_2, a_r and only one choice</span> <span m="2788000">for a_0 if they're going to collide.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2795000">If they're not going to collide, I've got more choices</span> <span m="2800000">for a_0. But if I want them to collide,</span> <span m="2803000">there's only one value I can pick, namely this value.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2808000">That's the only value for which I will pick.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2813000">And that's equal to m to the r, which is just the size of H</span> <span m="2818000">divided by m. And that completes the proof.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2831000">So there are other universal constructions,</span> <span m="2834000">but this is a particularly elegant one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2838000">So the point is that I have m plus one, sorry,</span> <span m="2842000">r plus one degrees of freedom where each degree of freedom I</span> <span m="2847000">have m choices. But if I want them to collide,</span> <span m="2853000">once I've picked any of the, once I've picked r of those</span> <span m="2860000">possible choices, the last one is forced if I</span> <span m="2865000">want it to collide. So therefore,</span> <span m="2868000">the set of functions for which it collides is only one in m.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2875000">A very slick construction. Very slick.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2881000">OK. Everybody with me here?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2883000">Didn't lose too many people? Yeah, question.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2887000">Well, part of it is, actually this is a quite common</span> <span m="2892000">type of thing to be doing actually.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2895000">If you take a class, so we have follow on classes in</span> <span m="2899000">cryptography and so forth, and this kind of thing of</span> <span m="2904000">taking dot products, modulo m and also Galois fields</span> <span m="2909000">which are particularly simple finite fields and things like</span> <span m="2914000">that, people play with these all the time.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2920000">So Galois fields are like using exor's as your,</span> <span m="2923000">same sort of thing as this except base two.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2926000">And so there's a lot of study of this sort of thing.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2929000">So people understand these kind of properties.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2933000">But yeah, it's like what's the algorithm for having a brilliant</span> <span m="2937000">insight into algorithms? It's like OK.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2941000">Wish I knew. Then I'd just turn the crank.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2945000">[LAUGHTER] But if it were that easy, I wouldn't be standing up</span> <span m="2951000">here today. [LAUGHTER] Good.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2953000">OK, so now I want to take on another topic which is also I</span> <span m="2959000">find, I think this is astounding.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2962000">It's just beautiful, beautiful mathematics and a big</span> <span m="2967000">impact on your ability to build good hash functions.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2974000">Now I want to talk about another one topic,</span> <span m="2977000">which is related, which is the topic of perfect</span> <span m="2981000">hashing.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2994000">So everything we've done so far does expected time performance.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2999000">Hashing is good in the expected sense.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3003000">A perfect hashing addresses the following questions.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3008000">Suppose that I gave you a set of keys, and I said just build</span> <span m="3014000">me a static table so I can look up whether the key is in the</span> <span m="3020000">table with worst case time. Good worst case time.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3025000">So I have a fixed set of keys. They might be something like</span> <span m="3031000">for example, the hundred most common or thousand most common</span> <span m="3037000">words in English. And when I get a word I want to</span> <span m="3042000">check quickly in this table, is the word that I've got one</span> <span m="3047000">of the most common words in English.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3049000">I would like to do that not with expected performance,</span> <span m="3054000">but guaranteed worst case performance.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3057000">Is there a way of building it so that I can find this quickly?</span> </p>
<p><span m="3063000">So the problem is given n keys --</span> <span m="3072000">-- construct a static hash table.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3074000">In other words, no insertion and deletion.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3077000">We're just going to put the elements in there.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3080000">A size --</span> <span m="3090000">-- m equal Order n. So I don't want it to be a huge</span> <span m="3097000">table. I want it to be a table that is</span> <span m="3102000">the size of my keys. Table of size m equals Order n,</span> <span m="3110000">such that search takes O(1) time in the worst case.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3126000">So there's no place in the table where I'm going to have,</span> <span m="3130000">I know in the average case, that's not hard to do.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3134000">But in the worst case, I want to make sure that</span> <span m="3138000">there's no particular spot where the number of keys piles up to</span> <span m="3142000">be a large number. OK, in no spot should that</span> <span m="3146000">happen. Every single search I do should</span> <span m="3149000">take Order one time. There shouldn't be any</span> <span m="3153000">statistical variation in terms of how long it takes me to get</span> <span m="3157000">something. Does everybody understand what</span> <span m="3159000">the puzzle is? So this is a great,</span> <span m="3162000">because this actually ends up having a lot of uses.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3165000">You know, you want to build a table for something and you know</span> <span m="3169000">what the values are that you're going look up in it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3172000">But you don't want to spend a lot of space on it and so forth.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3176000">So the idea here is actually going to be to use a two-level</span> <span m="3180000">scheme.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3189000">So the idea is we're going to use a two-level scheme with</span> <span m="3202000">universal hashing at both levels.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3211000">So the idea is we're going to hash, we're going to have a hash</span> <span m="3216000">table, we're going to hash into slots, but rather than using</span> <span m="3221000">chaining, we're going to have another hash table there.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3226000">We're going to do a second hash into the second hash table.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3231000">And the idea is that we're going to do it in such a way</span> <span m="3236000">that we have no collisions at level two.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3241000">So we may have collisions at level one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3243000">We'll take anything that collides at level one and put</span> <span m="3248000">them into a hash table and then our second level hash table,</span> <span m="3252000">but that hash table, no collisions.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3255000">Boom. We're just going to hash right</span> <span m="3257000">in there. And it'll just go boom to its</span> <span m="3260000">thing. So let's draw a picture of this</span> <span m="3263000">to illustrate the scheme. OK, so we have --</span> <span m="3274000">-- 0 one, let's say six, m minus one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3277000">So here's our hash table. And what we're going to do is</span> <span m="3282000">we're going to use universal hashing at the first level,</span> <span m="3287000">OK. So we find a universal hash</span> <span m="3289000">function. We pick a hash function at</span> <span m="3292000">random. And what we'll do is we'll hash</span> <span m="3296000">into that level. And then what we'll do is we'll</span> <span m="3300000">keep track of two things. One is what the size of the</span> <span m="3305000">hash table is at the next level. So in this case,</span> <span m="3309000">the size of the hash table will only use the number of slots.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3313000">There's going to be four. And we're also going to keep a</span> <span m="3317000">separate hash key for the second level.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3319000">So each slot will have its own hash function for the second</span> <span m="3323000">level. So for example,</span> <span m="3325000">this one might have a key of 31 that is a random number.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3330000">The a's here. a's up there.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3332000">There we go, a's up there.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3334000">So that's going to be the basis of my hash function,</span> <span m="3339000">the key with which I'm going to hash.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3342000">This one say has 86. And let's say that this,</span> <span m="3346000">and then we have a pointer to the hash table.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3350000">This is say S_1. And it's got four slots and we</span> <span m="3355000">stored up 14 and 27. And these two slots are empty.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3361000">And this one for example, had what?</span> </p>
<p><span m="3369000">Two nines.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3388000">So the idea here is that in this case if we look over all</span> <span m="3394000">our top level hash function, which I'll just call H,</span> <span m="3400000">has that H of 14 is equal to H of 27 is equal to one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3407000">Because we're in slot one. OK, so these two both hash to</span> <span m="3413000">the same slot in the level one hash table.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3417000">This is level one. And this is level two over</span> <span m="3422000">here. So level one hashing,</span> <span m="3426000">14 and 27 collided. They went into the same slot</span> <span m="3431000">here. But at level two,</span> <span m="3433000">they got hashed to different places and the hash function I</span> <span m="3440000">use is going to be indexed by whatever the random numbers are</span> <span m="3446000">that I chose and found for those and I'll show you how we find</span> <span m="3453000">those. We have then h of 31 of 14 is</span> <span m="3456000">equal to one h of 31 of 27 is equal to two.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3463000">For level two. So I go, hash in here,</span> <span m="3466000">find the, use this as the basis of my hash function to hash into</span> <span m="3471000">whatever table I've got here. And so, if there are no,</span> <span m="3475000">if I can guarantee that there are no collisions at level two,</span> <span m="3480000">this is going to cost me Order one time in the worst case to</span> <span m="3485000">look something up. How do I look it up?</span> </p>
<p><span m="3489000">Take the value. I apply h to it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3492000">That takes me to some slot. Then I look to see what the key</span> <span m="3496000">is for this hash function. I apply that hash function and</span> <span m="3501000">that takes me to another slot. Then I go there.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3504000">And that took me basically two applications of hash functions</span> <span m="3509000">plus some look-up, plus who knows what minor</span> <span m="3513000">amount of bookkeeping. So the reason we're going to</span> <span m="3521000">have no collisions at this level is the following.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3530000">If they're n sub i items that hash to a level one slot i,</span> <span m="3541000">then we're going to use m sub i, which is equal to n sub i</span> <span m="3551000">squared slots in the level two hash table.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3569000">OK, so I should have mentioned here this is going to be m sub</span> <span m="3573000">i, the size of the hash table and this is going to be my a sub</span> <span m="3577000">i essentially.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3585000">So I'm going to use, so basically I'm going to hash</span> <span m="3590000">n sub i things into n sub i squared locations here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3595000">So this is going to be incredibly sparse.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3600000">OK, it's going to be quadratic in size.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3602480">And so what I'm going to show is that under those</span> <span m="3605612">circumstances, it's easy for me to find hash</span> <span m="3608418">functions such that there are n collisions.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3611159">That's the name of the game. Figure out how can I make these</span> <span m="3615010">hash functions so that there are no collisions.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3618012">So that's why I draw this with so few elements here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3621341">So here for example, I have two elements and I have</span> <span m="3624604">a hash table size four here. I have three elements.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3627867">I need a hash table size nine. OK, if there are a hundred</span> <span m="3632520">elements, I need a hash table size 10,000.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3634918">I'm not going to pick something so there's likely that there's</span> <span m="3638485">anything of that size. And then the fact that this</span> <span m="3641350">actually works and gives us all the properties that we want,</span> <span m="3644801">that's part of the analysis. So does everybody see that this</span> <span m="3648251">takes Order one worst case time and what the basic structure of</span> <span m="3651877">it is? These things,</span> <span m="3652988">by the way, are not in this case prime.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3655210">I could always pick primes that were close to this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3658134">I didn't do that in this case. Or I could use a universal hash</span> <span m="3663730">function that in fact would work for things other than primes.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3669103">But I didn't do that for this example.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3672362">We all ready for analysis? OK, let's do some analysis</span> <span m="3676943">then.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3689000">And this is really pretty analysis.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3691000">Partly as you'll see because we've already done some of this</span> <span m="3693528">analysis.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3710000">So the trick is analyzing level two.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3713238">That's the main thing that I want to analyze,</span> <span m="3717309">to show that I can find hash functions here that are going</span> <span m="3722583">to, when I map them into, very sparsely,</span> <span m="3726192">into these arrays here, that in fact,</span> <span m="3729523">such hash functions exist and I can compute them in advance.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3736000">So that I have a good way of storing those.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3743344">So here's the theorem we're going to use.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3750338">My hash and keys into m equals n squared slots using a random</span> <span m="3760830">hash function in a universal set H.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3768000">Then the expected number of collisions is less than one</span> <span m="3780393">half. OK.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3782502">The expected number of collisions I don't expect there</span> <span m="3791372">to be even one collision. I expect there to be less than</span> <span m="3800577">half a collision on average. And so, let's prove this,</span> <span m="3809447">so that the probability that two given keys collide under h</span> <span m="3819154">is what? What's the probability that two</span> <span m="3825216">given keys collide under h when h is chosen randomly from the</span> <span m="3831443">universal set? One over m.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3834037">Right? That's the definition,</span> <span m="3836943">right, of, which is in this case equal to one over n</span> <span m="3842235">squared. So now how many keys,</span> <span m="3846210">how many pairs of keys do I have in this table?</span> </p>
<p><span m="3851052">How many keys could possibly collide with each other?</span> </p>
<p><span m="3856526">OK. So that's basically just</span> <span m="3859368">looking at how many different pairs of keys do I have to</span> <span m="3865157">evaluate this for. So that's n choose two pairs of</span> <span m="3870315">keys. n choose two pairs of keys.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3876654">So therefore, the expected number of</span> <span m="3882689">collisions is while for each of these n, not n over two.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3892172">n choose two pairs of keys. The probability that it</span> <span m="3900793">collides is one in n squared. So that's equal to n times n</span> <span m="3908923">minus one over two, if you remember your formula,</span> <span m="3912221">times one in n squared. And that's less than a half.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3924000">So for every pair of keys, so those of you who remember</span> <span m="3928183">from 6.042 the birthday paradox, this is related to the birthday</span> <span m="3933063">paradox a little bit. But here I basically have a</span> <span m="3936800">large set, and I'm looking at all pairs, but my set is</span> <span m="3940333">sufficiently big that the odds that I get a collision is</span> <span m="3944000">relatively small. If I start increasing it beyond</span> <span m="3947199">the square root of m, OK, the number of elements,</span> <span m="3950400">it starts getting bigger in the square root of m then the odds</span> <span m="3954466">of a collision go up dramatically as you know from</span> <span m="3957733">the birthday paradox. But if I'm less than,</span> <span m="3961532">if I'm really sparse in there, I don't get collisions.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3965401">Or at least I get a relatively small number expected.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3969197">Now I want to remind you of something which actually in the</span> <span m="3973430">past I have just assumed, but I want to actually go</span> <span m="3977080">through it briefly. It's Markov's inequality.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3980291">So who remembers Markov's inequality?</span> </p>
<p><span m="3982919">Don't everybody raise their hand at once.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3985839">So Markov's inequality says the following.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3990000">This is one of these great probability facts.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3994145">For random variable x which is bounded below by 0,</span> <span m="3998762">says the probability that x is bigger than, greater than or</span> <span m="4004227">equal to any given value T is less than or equal to the</span> <span m="4009316">expectation of x divided by T. It's a great fact.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4013838">Doesn't happen if x isn't bound below by 0.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4017796">But it's a great fact. It allows me to relate the</span> <span m="4023230">probability of an event to its expectation.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4026833">And the idea is in general that if the expectation is going to</span> <span m="4032066">be small, then I can't have a high probability that the value</span> <span m="4037213">of the random variable is large. It doesn't make sense.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4041845">How could you have a high probability that it's a million</span> <span m="4046649">when my expectation is one or in this case we're going to apply</span> <span m="4051968">it when the expectation is a half?</span> </p>
<p><span m="4056000">Couldn't happen. And the proof follows just</span> <span m="4059676">directly on the definition of expectation, and so I'mdoing</span> <span m="4064666">this for a discrete random variable.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4067730">So the expectation by definition is just the sum from</span> <span m="4072282">little x goes to 0 to infinity of x times the probability that</span> <span m="4077622">my random variable takes on the value x.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4082000">That's the definition. And now it's just a question of</span> <span m="4086560">doing like the coarsest approximation you can imagine.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4091120">First of all, let me just simply throw away</span> <span m="4094734">all small terms that can be greater to or equal to x equals</span> <span m="4099725">T to infinity of x times the probability that x is equal to</span> <span m="4104716">little x. So just throw away all the low</span> <span m="4108072">order terms. Now what I'm going to do is</span> <span m="4111426">replace every one of these terms is lower bounded by the value x</span> <span m="4116848">equals T. So that's just the summation of</span> <span m="4122875">x equals T to infinity of T times the probability that x</span> <span m="4129750">equals x. OK.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4131250">Over x going from T larger. Because these are only bigger</span> <span m="4138250">values. And that's just equal then to</span> <span m="4142009">T, because I can pull that out, and the summation of x equals T</span> <span m="4146306">to infinity of the probability that x equals x is just the</span> <span m="4150256">probability that x is greater than or equal to T.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4160000">And that's done because I just divide by T.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4171000">So that's Markov's inequality. Really dumb.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4174379">Really simple. There are much stronger things</span> <span m="4177919">like Chebyshev bounds and Chernoff bounds and things of</span> <span m="4182264">that nature. But Markov's is like</span> <span m="4184839">unbelievably simple and useful. So we're going to just apply</span> <span m="4189586">that as a corollary.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4206000">So the probability now of no collisions, when I hash n keys</span> <span m="4213059">into n squared slots using a universal hash function,</span> <span m="4219391">I claim is the probability of no collisions is greater than or</span> <span m="4226817">equal to a half. So I pick a hash function at</span> <span m="4232173">random. What are the odds that I got no</span> <span m="4236409">collisions when I hashed those n keys into n squared slots?</span> </p>
<p><span m="4240917">Answer. Probability is I have no</span> <span m="4243326">collisions is at least a half. Half the time I'm guaranteed</span> <span m="4247834">that there won't be a collision. And the proof,</span> <span m="4251409">pretty simple. The probability of no</span> <span m="4254129">collisions is the same as the probability as,</span> <span m="4257549">sorry, is one minus the probability that I have at most</span> <span m="4261746">one collision. So the odds that I have at</span> <span m="4265850">least one collision, the odds that I have at least</span> <span m="4269337">one collision, probability greater than or</span> <span m="4272254">equal to one collision is less than or equal to,</span> <span m="4275599">now I just apply Markov's inequality with this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4278872">So it's just the expected number of collisions --</span> <span m="4289000">-- divided by one. And that is by Markov's</span> <span m="4293090">inequality less than, by definition,</span> <span m="4296272">excuse me, of expected number of collisions,</span> <span m="4300181">which we've already shown, is less than a half.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4304363">So the probability of at least one collision is less than a</span> <span m="4309636">half. The probability of 0 collisions</span> <span m="4312909">is at least a half. So we're done here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4316363">So to find a good level to hash function is easy.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4322000">I just test a few at random. Most of them out there,</span> <span m="4326562">OK, half of them, at least half of them are going</span> <span m="4330856">to work. So this is in some sense,</span> <span m="4333808">if you think about it, a randomized construction,</span> <span m="4338102">because I can't tell you which one it's going to be.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4342664">It's non-constructive in that sense, but it's a randomized</span> <span m="4347763">construction. But they have to exist because</span> <span m="4352485">most of them out there have this good property.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4356297">So I'mgoing to be able to find for each one of these,</span> <span m="4360605">I just test a few at random, and I find one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4364168">Test a few at random, find one, etc.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4367068">Fill in my table there. Because all that is</span> <span m="4370548">pre-computation. And I'mgoing to find them</span> <span m="4373945">because the odds are good that one exists.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4377342">So --</span> <span m="4393000">-- we just test a few at random.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4404000">And we'll find one quickly --</span> <span m="4412000">-- since at least half will work.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4414300">I just want to show that there exists good ones.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4417679">All I have to prove is that at least one works for each of</span> <span m="4421777">these cases. In fact, I've shown that</span> <span m="4424366">there's a huge number that will work.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4426954">Half of them will work. But to show it exists,</span> <span m="4430189">I would just have to show that the probability was greater than</span> <span m="4435941">we need to still analyze the storage because I promised in my</span> <span m="4440254">theorem that the table would be of size order n.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4445000">And yet now I've said there's all of these quadratic-sized</span> <span m="4452702">slots here. So I'mgoing to show that that's</span> <span m="4458378">order n.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4471000">So for level one, that's easy.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4475605">We'll just choose the number of slots to be equal to the number</span> <span m="4485450">of keys. And that way the storage at</span> <span m="4491008">level one is just order n. And now let's let n sub i be</span> <span m="4499583">the random variable for the number of keys --</span> <span m="4513000">-- that hash to slot i in T. OK, so n sub i is just what</span> <span m="4521712">we've called it. Number of elements that slot</span> <span m="4528683">there. And we're going to use m sub i</span> <span m="4534386">equals n sub i squared slots in each level two table S sub i.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4545000">So the expected total storage --</span> <span m="4554000">-- is just n for level one, order n if you want,</span> <span m="4561085">but basically n slots for level one plus the expected value,</span> <span m="4569979">whatever I expect the sum of i equals 0 to m minus one of theta</span> <span m="4579326">of n sub i squared to be.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4590000">Because I basically have to add up the square for every element</span> <span m="4596048">that applies here, the square of what's in there.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4600731">Who recognizes this summation? Where have we seen that before?</span> </p>
<p><span m="4606682">Who attends recitation? Where have we seen this before?</span> </p>
<p><span m="4611951">What's the --</span> <span m="4623000">We're summing the expected value of a bunch of --</span> <span m="4631000">Yeah, what was that algorithm? We did the sorting algorithm,</span> <span m="4634959">right? What was the sorting algorithm</span> <span m="4637375">for which this was an important thing to evaluate?</span> </p>
<p><span m="4646000">Don't everybody shout it out at once.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4649272">What was that sorting algorithm called?</span> </p>
<p><span m="4653000">Bucket sort. Good.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4655397">Bucket sort. Yeah.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4657794">We showed that the sum of the squares of random variables when</span> <span m="4666397">they're falling randomly into n bins is order n.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4673025">Right?</span> </p>
<p><span m="4696000">And you can also out of this get a, as we did before,</span> <span m="4700105">get a probability bound. What's the probability that</span> <span m="4704131">it's more than a certain amount times n using Markov's</span> <span m="4708315">inequality. But this is the key thing is</span> <span m="4711394">we've seen this analysis. OK, we used it there in time,</span> <span m="4716109">so there's a little bit, but that's one of the reasons</span> <span m="4719963">we study sorting at the beginning of the term is because</span> <span m="4723963">the techniques of sorting, they just propagate into all</span> <span m="4727890">these other areas of analysis. You see a lot of the same kinds</span> <span m="4732327">of things. And so now that you know bucket</span> <span m="4735309">sort clearly so well, now you know that this without</span> <span m="4739018">having to do any extra work. So you might want to go back</span> <span m="4744610">and review your bucket sort analysis, because it's applied</span> <span m="4749925">now. Same analysis.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4751604">Two places. OK.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4752909">Good recitation this Friday, which will be a quiz review and</span> <span m="4758411">we have a quiz next, there's no class on Monday,</span> <span m="4762794">but we have a quiz on next Wednesday.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4766151">OK, so good luck everybody on the quiz.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4771000">Make sure you get plenty of sleep.</span> </p>
