<p><span m="13000">And this is going to use some of the techniques we learned</span> <span m="20000">last time with respect to amortized analysis.</span> </p>
<p><span m="25000">And, what's neat about what we're going to talk about today</span> <span m="32000">is it's a way of comparing algorithms that are so-called</span> <span m="39000">online algorithms. And we're going to introduce</span> <span m="48000">this notion with a problem which is called self organizing lists.</span> </p>
<p><span m="60000">OK, and so the set up for this problem is that we have a list,</span> <span m="70000">L, of n elements. And, we have an operation.</span> </p>
<p><span m="77000">Woops, I've got to spell things right, access of x,</span> <span m="86000">which accesses item x in the list.</span> </p>
<p><span m="93000">It could be by searching, or it could be however you want</span> <span m="100000">to do it. But basically,</span> <span m="102000">it goes and touches that element.</span> </p>
<p><span m="106000">And we were to say the cost of that operation is whatever the</span> <span m="114000">rank of x is in the list, which is just the distance of x</span> <span m="121000">from the head of the list. And the other thing that we can</span> <span m="130000">do that the algorithm can do, so this is what the user would</span> <span m="138000">do. He just simply runs a whole</span> <span m="142000">bunch of accesses on the list, OK, accessing one element after</span> <span m="150000">another in any order that he or she cares to.</span> </p>
<p><span m="156000">And then, L can be reordered, however, by transposing</span> <span m="163000">adjacent elements. And the cost for that is one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="173000">So, for example, suppose the list is the</span> <span m="181000">following.</span> </p>
<p><span m="201000">OK, I missed something here. It doesn't matter.</span> </p>
<p><span m="209000">Well, I'll just make it be what I have so that it matches the</span> <span m="220000">online video. OK, so here we have a list.</span> </p>
<p><span m="226000">And so, if I do something like access element 14 here,</span> <span m="231000">the element of key 14, OK, that this costs me one,</span> <span m="236000">two, three, four. So here the cost is four to</span> <span m="241000">access. And so, we're going to have</span> <span m="245000">some sequence of accesses that the user is going to do.</span> </p>
<p><span m="250000">And obviously, if something is accessed more</span> <span m="254000">frequently, we'd like to move it up to the front of the list so</span> <span m="261000">that you don't have to search as far.</span> </p>
<p><span m="264000">OK, and to do that, if I want to transpose</span> <span m="268000">something, so, for example,</span> <span m="271000">if I transpose three and 50, that just costs me one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="278000">OK, so then I would make this be 50, and make this be three.</span> </p>
<p><span m="283000">OK, sorry, normally you just do it by swapping pointers.</span> </p>
<p><span m="289000">OK, so those are the two operations.</span> </p>
<p><span m="292000">And, we are going to do this in what's called an online fashion.</span> </p>
<p><span m="299000">So, let's just define online. So, a sequence,</span> <span m="306000">S, of operations is provided one at a time for each</span> <span m="316000">operation. An online algorithm must</span> <span m="324000">execute the operation immediately without getting a</span> <span m="334000">chance to look at what else is coming in the sequence.</span> </p>
<p><span m="348000">So, when you make your decision for the first element,</span> <span m="351000">you don't get to see ahead as to what the second,</span> <span m="354000">or third, or whatever is. And the second one you get,</span> <span m="357000">you get and you have to make your decision as to what to do</span> <span m="360000">and so forth. So, that's an online algorithm.</span> </p>
<p><span m="366000">Similarly, an off-line algorithm, OK,</span> <span m="371000">may see all of S in advance. OK, so you can see an off-line</span> <span m="378000">algorithm gets to see the whole sequence, and then decide what</span> <span m="387000">it wants to do about element one, element two,</span> <span m="393000">or whatever. OK, so an off-line algorithm</span> <span m="397000">can look at the whole sequence and say, OK, I can see that item</span> <span m="401000">number 17 is being accessed a lot, or early on move him up</span> <span m="405000">closer to the front of the list, and then the accesses cost less</span> <span m="409000">for the off-line algorithm. The online algorithm doesn't</span> <span m="413000">get to see any of that. OK, so this is sort of like,</span> <span m="416000">if you're familiar with the game Tetris.</span> </p>
<p><span m="420000">OK, and Tetris, you get one shape after another</span> <span m="422000">that starts coming down, and you have to twiddle it,</span> <span m="425000">and move it to the side, and drop it into place.</span> </p>
<p><span m="428000">And there, sometimes you get a one step look-ahead on some of</span> <span m="431000">them so you can see what the next shape is,</span> <span m="434000">but often it's purely online. You don't get to see that next</span> <span m="437000">shape or whatever, and you have to make a decision</span> <span m="440000">for each one. And you make a decision,</span> <span m="442000">and you realize that the next shape, ah, if you had made a</span> <span m="446000">different decision it would have been better.</span> </p>
<p><span m="448000">OK, so that's the kind of problem.</span> </p>
<p><span m="452000">Off-line Tetris would be, I get to see the whole sequence</span> <span m="458000">of shapes. And now let me decide what I'm</span> <span m="462000">going to do with this one. OK, and so, in this,</span> <span m="467000">the goal is for any of the algorithms, either online or</span> <span m="473000">off-line is to minimize the total cost, which we'll denote</span> <span m="480000">by, I forgot to name this. This is algorithm A here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="486000">The total cost, C_A of S, OK,</span> <span m="489000">so the cost of algorithm A on the sequence,</span> <span m="493000">S. That's just the notation we'll</span> <span m="496000">use for what the total cost is. So, any questions about the</span> <span m="502000">setup to this problem? So, we have an online problem.</span> </p>
<p><span m="507000">We're going to get these things one at a time,</span> <span m="512000">OK, and we have to decide what to do.</span> </p>
<p><span m="517000">So, let's do a worst-case analysis for this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="532000">OK, so if we're doing a worst-case analysis,</span> <span m="536000">we can view that we have an adversary that we are playing</span> <span m="541000">against who's going to provide the sequence.</span> </p>
<p><span m="546000">The user is going to be able to see what we do.</span> </p>
<p><span m="550000">And so, what's the adversary strategy?</span> </p>
<p><span m="554000">Thwart our plots, yes, that's his idea.</span> </p>
<p><span m="558000">And how is he going to thwart them, or she?</span> </p>
<p><span m="562000">Which is what for this problem? What's he going to do?</span> </p>
<p><span m="569000">Yeah. No matter how we reorder</span> <span m="572000">elements using the transposes, he's going to look at every</span> <span m="579000">step and say, what's the last element?</span> </p>
<p><span m="583000">That's the one I'm going to access, right?</span> </p>
<p><span m="588000">So, the adversary always, always accesses the tail</span> <span m="593000">element of L. No matter what it is,</span> <span m="597000">no matter how we reorder things, OK, for each one,</span> <span m="603000">adversary just accesses the tail.</span> </p>
<p><span m="609000">So the cost of this, of any algorithm,</span> <span m="613000">then, is going to be omega size of S times n,</span> <span m="618000">OK, because you're always going to pay for every sequence.</span> </p>
<p><span m="625000">You're going to have to go in to pay a cost of n,</span> <span m="631000">OK, for every element in the sequence.</span> </p>
<p><span m="636000">OK, so not terribly in the worst-case.</span> </p>
<p><span m="642000">Not terribly good. So, people in studying this</span> <span m="646000">problem: question? That analysis is for the online</span> <span m="650000">algorithm, right. The off-line algorithm,</span> <span m="654000">right, if you named those things, that's right.</span> </p>
<p><span m="659000">OK, so we're looking at trying to solve this in an off-line</span> <span m="663000">sense, sorry, in an online sense.</span> </p>
<p><span m="666000">OK, and so the point is that for the online algorithm,</span> <span m="670000">the adversary can be incredibly mean, OK, and just always access</span> <span m="675000">the thing at the end, OK?</span> </p>
<p><span m="677000">So, what sort of the history of this problem is,</span> <span m="681000">that people said, well, if I can't do well in the</span> <span m="684000">worst-case, maybe I should be looking at average case,</span> <span m="689000">OK, and look at, say, the different elements</span> <span m="692000">having some probability distribution.</span> </p>
<p><span m="697000">OK, so the average case analysis, OK,</span> <span m="704000">let's suppose that element x is accessed with probability,</span> <span m="716000">P of x. OK, so suppose that we have</span> <span m="723000">some a priori distribution on the elements.</span> </p>
<p><span m="734000">OK, then the expected cost of the algorithm on a sequence,</span> <span m="740000">OK, so if I put all the elements into some order,</span> <span m="746000">OK, and don't try to reorder, but just simply look at,</span> <span m="753000">is there a static ordering that would work well for a</span> <span m="759000">distribution? It's just going to be,</span> <span m="764000">by definition of expectation, the probability of x times,</span> <span m="769000">in this case, the cost, which is the rank of</span> <span m="774000">x in whatever that ordering is that I decide I'm going to use.</span> </p>
<p><span m="781000">OK, and this is minimized when? So, this is just the definition</span> <span m="789000">of expectations: the probability that I access x</span> <span m="795000">times the cost summed over all the elements.</span> </p>
<p><span m="801000">And the cost is just going to be its position in the list.</span> </p>
<p><span m="808000">So, when is this value, this summation,</span> <span m="813000">going to be minimized? When the element is most likely</span> <span m="821000">as the lowest rank, and then what,</span> <span m="824000">what about the other element? OK, so what does that mean?</span> </p>
<p><span m="829000">Yeah, sort them, yeah, sort them on the basis of</span> <span m="834000">decreasing probability, OK?</span> </p>
<p><span m="838000">So, it's minimized when L is sorted, OK, in decreasing order</span> <span m="844000">with respect to P. OK, so just sort them with the</span> <span m="850000">most likely one at the front, and then just decreasing</span> <span m="856000">probability. That way, whenever I access</span> <span m="860000">something with some probability, OK, I'm going to access,</span> <span m="867000">it's more likely that I'm going to access.</span> </p>
<p><span m="873000">And that's not too difficult to actually prove.</span> </p>
<p><span m="877000">You just look at, suppose there were two that</span> <span m="881000">were out of order, and show that if you swap them,</span> <span m="886000">you would improve this optimization function.</span> </p>
<p><span m="890000">OK, so if you didn't know it, this suggests the following</span> <span m="896000">heuristic, OK, which is simply keep</span> <span m="905000">account of the number of times each element is accessed,</span> <span m="921000">and maintain the list in order of decreasing count.</span> </p>
<p><span m="938000">OK, so whenever something is accessed, increment its count,</span> <span m="942000">OK, and that will move it, at most, one position,</span> <span m="945000">which only costs me one transposed to move it,</span> <span m="948000">perhaps, forward. OK, actually,</span> <span m="950000">I guess it could be more if you have a whole bunch of ties,</span> <span m="954000">right? Yeah.</span> </p>
<p><span m="955000">So, it could cost more. But the idea is,</span> <span m="958000">over time, the law of large numbers says that this is going</span> <span m="962000">to approach the probability distribution.</span> </p>
<p><span m="966000">The frequency with which you access this, divided by the</span> <span m="971000">total number of accesses, will be the probability.</span> </p>
<p><span m="975000">And so, therefore you will get things in decreasing</span> <span m="980000">probability, OK, assuming that there is some</span> <span m="984000">distribution that all of these elements are chosen according</span> <span m="989000">to, or accessed according to. So, it doesn't seem like</span> <span m="995000">there's that much more you could really do here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1000000">And that's why I think this notion of competitive analysis</span> <span m="1006000">is so persuasive, because it's really amazingly</span> <span m="1011000">strong, OK? And it came about because of</span> <span m="1015000">what people were doing in practice.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1020000">So practice, what people implement it was a</span> <span m="1024000">so-called move to front heuristic.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1027000">OK, and the basic idea was, after you access an element,</span> <span m="1032000">just move it up to the front. OK, that only doubles the cost</span> <span m="1038000">of accessing the element because I go and I access it,</span> <span m="1044000">chasing it down paying the rank, and then I have to do rank</span> <span m="1049000">number of transposes to bring it back to the front.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1056000">So, it only cost me a factor of two, and now,</span> <span m="1059000">if it happens to be a frequently accessed elements,</span> <span m="1063000">over time you would hope that the most likely elements were</span> <span m="1067000">near the front of that list. So, after accessing x,</span> <span m="1075000">move x, the head of the list using transposes,</span> <span m="1085000">and the cost is just equal to twice the rank in L of x,</span> <span m="1097000">OK, where the two here has two parts.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1105000">One is the access, and the other is the</span> <span m="1114000">transposes. OK, so that's sort of what they</span> <span m="1121000">did. And one of the nice properties</span> <span m="1123000">of this is that if it turns out that there is locality in the</span> <span m="1127000">access pattern, if it's not just a static</span> <span m="1130000">distribution, but rather once I've accessed</span> <span m="1133000">something, if it's more likely I'm going to access it again,</span> <span m="1137000">which tends to be the case for many input types of patterns,</span> <span m="1141000">this responds well to locality because it's going to be up near</span> <span m="1145000">the front if I access it very soon after I've accessed.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1150000">So, there is what's called temporal locality,</span> <span m="1155000">meaning that in time, I tend to access,</span> <span m="1159000">so it may be that I access some thing's very hot for awhile;</span> <span m="1166000">then it gets very cold. This type of algorithm responds</span> <span m="1172000">very well to the hotness of the accessing.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1177000">OK, so it responds well to locality in S.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1183000">So, this is sort of what was known up to the point that a</span> <span m="1188000">very famous paper was written by Danny Sleator and Bob Tarjan,</span> <span m="1194000">where they took a totally different approach to looking at</span> <span m="1199000">this kind of problem. OK, and it's an approach that</span> <span m="1204000">matter you see everywhere from analysis of caching and</span> <span m="1209000">high-performance processors to analyses of disk paging to just</span> <span m="1214000">a huge number of applications of this basic technique.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1221000">And, that's the technique of competitive analysis.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1230000">OK, so here's the definition. So, online algorithm A is alpha</span> <span m="1245000">competitive. If there exists a constant,</span> <span m="1255000">k, such that for any sequence, S, of operations,</span> <span m="1268000">the cost of S using algorithm A is bounded by alpha times the</span> <span m="1283000">cost of opt, where opt is the optimal offline algorithm.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1299000">OK, so the optimal off-line, the one that knows the whole</span> <span m="1303000">sequence and does the absolute best it could do on that</span> <span m="1307000">sequence, OK, that's this cost here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1310000">This is sometimes called God's algorithm, OK,</span> <span m="1313000">not to bring religion into the classroom, or to offend anybody,</span> <span m="1318000">but that is what people sometimes call it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1323000">OK, so the fully omniscient knows absolutely the best thing</span> <span m="1327000">that could be done, sees into the future,</span> <span m="1330000">the whole works, OK?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1332000">It gets to apply that. That's what opts algorithm is.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1336000">And, what we're saying is that the cost is basically whatever</span> <span m="1341000">this alpha factor is. It could be a function of</span> <span m="1344000">things, or it could be a constant, OK,</span> <span m="1347000">times whatever the best algorithm is.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1350000">Plus, there's a potential for a constant out here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1356000">OK, so for example, if alpha is two,</span> <span m="1358000">and we say it's two competitive, that means you're</span> <span m="1363000">going to do, at worst, twice the algorithm that has</span> <span m="1367000">all the information. But you're doing it online,</span> <span m="1371000">for example. OK, it's a really pretty</span> <span m="1374000">powerful notion. And what's interesting about</span> <span m="1377000">this, it's not even clear these things should exist to my mind.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1384000">OK, what's pretty remarkable about this, I think,</span> <span m="1388000">is that there is no assumption of distribution,</span> <span m="1392000">of probability distribution or anything.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1396000">It's whatever the sequence is that you give it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1400000">You are within a factor of alpha, essentially,</span> <span m="1404000">of the best algorithm, OK, which is pretty remarkable.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1410000">OK, and so, we're going to prove the following theorem,</span> <span m="1418000">which is the one that Sleator and Tarjan proved.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1425000">And that is that MTF is four competitive for self organizing</span> <span m="1435000">lists. OK, so the idea here is that</span> <span m="1438000">suppose the adversary says, oh, I'm always going to access</span> <span m="1442000">the thing at the end of the list like we said in the beginning.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1446000">So, the adversary says, I'm always going to access the</span> <span m="1450000">thing there. I'm going to make MTF work</span> <span m="1452000">really bad, because you're going to go and move that thing all</span> <span m="1456000">the way up to the front. And I'm just going to access</span> <span m="1460000">the thing way at the end again. OK, well it turns out,</span> <span m="1463000">yeah, that's a bad sequence for move to front,</span> <span m="1466000">OK, and it will take a long time.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1470000">But it turns out God couldn't have done better,</span> <span m="1474000">OK, by more than a factor of four no matter how long the list</span> <span m="1480000">is. OK, that's pretty amazing.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1483000">OK, so that's a bad sequence. But, if there's a way that the</span> <span m="1489000">sequence exhibits any kind of locality or anything that can be</span> <span m="1495000">taken advantage of, if you could see the whole</span> <span m="1500000">thing, MTF takes advantage of it too, OK, within a factor of</span> <span m="1506000">four. OK, it's a pretty remarkable</span> <span m="1510000">theorem, and it's the basis of many types of analysis of online</span> <span m="1514000">algorithms. Almost all online algorithms</span> <span m="1517000">today are analyzed using some kind of competitive analysis.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1521000">OK, not always. Sometimes you do probabilistic</span> <span m="1525000">analysis, or whatever, but the dominant thing is too</span> <span m="1528000">competitive analysis because then you don't have to make any</span> <span m="1533000">statistical assumptions. OK, just prove that it works</span> <span m="1538000">well no matter what. This is remarkable,</span> <span m="1540000">I think. Isn't it remarkable?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1542000">So, let's prove this theorem, we're just going to spend the</span> <span m="1547000">rest of the lecture on this proof.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1549000">OK, and the proof in some ways is not hard, but it's also not</span> <span m="1554000">necessarily completely intuitive.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1556000">So, you will have to pay attention.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1560000">OK, so let's get some notation down.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1569000">Let's let L_i be MTF's list after the i'th access.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1582000">And, let's let L be opt's list after the i'th access.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1598000">OK, so generally what I'll do is I'll put a star if we are</span> <span m="1602000">talking about opt, and have nothing if we're</span> <span m="1606000">talking about MTF. OK, so that's going to be the</span> <span m="1610000">list. So, we can say,</span> <span m="1611000">what's the list? So, we're going to set it up</span> <span m="1615000">where we have one in operation that transforms list i minus one</span> <span m="1620000">into list i. OK, that's what the i'th</span> <span m="1623000">operation does. OK, and move to front does it</span> <span m="1629000">by moving whatever the thing that was accessed to the front.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1636000">And opt does whatever opt thinks is the best thing to do.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1643000">We don't know. So, we're going to let c_i be</span> <span m="1648000">MTF's cost for the I'th operation.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1653000">And that's just twice the rank in L_i minus one of x if the</span> <span m="1660000">operation accesses x, OK, two times the rank in L_i</span> <span m="1667000">minus one because we're going to be accessing it in L_i minus one</span> <span m="1675000">and transforming it into L_i. And similarly,</span> <span m="1681000">we'll let c_i star be opt's cost for the i'th operation.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1689000">And that's just equal to, well, to access it,</span> <span m="1694000">it's going to be the rank in L_i minus one star,</span> <span m="1700000">whatever its list is of x at that step, because it's got to</span> <span m="1708000">access it. And then, some number of</span> <span m="1714000">transposes, t_i if opt forms t_i transposes.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1721000">OK, so we have the setup where we have two different lists that</span> <span m="1731000">are being managed, and we have different costs in</span> <span m="1739000">the list. And, we're interested in is</span> <span m="1744000">comparing in some way MTF's list with opt's list at any point in</span> <span m="1751000">time. And, how do you think we're</span> <span m="1754000">going to do that? What technique do you think we</span> <span m="1759000">should use to compare these two lists, general technique from</span> <span m="1765000">last lecture? Well, it is going to be</span> <span m="1768000">amortized, but what? How are we going to compare</span> <span m="1775000">them? What technique did we learn</span> <span m="1779000">last time? Potential function,</span> <span m="1783000">good. OK, we're going to define a</span> <span m="1787000">potential function, OK, that measures how far apart</span> <span m="1794000">these two lists are. OK, and the idea is,</span> <span m="1799000">if, let's define that and then we'll take a look at it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1808000">So, we're going to define the potential function phi mapping</span> <span m="1821000">the set of MTF's lists into the real numbers by the following.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1837000">phi of L_i is going to be twice the cardinality of this set.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1864000">OK, so this is the precedes-operation and list,</span> <span m="1868000">i. So, we can define a</span> <span m="1870000">relationship between any two elements that says that x</span> <span m="1875000">precedes y in L_i if, as I'm accessing it from the</span> <span m="1880000">head, I hit x first. OK, so what I'm interested in,</span> <span m="1885000">here, are in some sense the disagreements between the two</span> <span m="1891000">lists. This is where x precedes y in</span> <span m="1895000">MTF's list, but y precedes x in opt's list.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1899000">They disagree, OK?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1900000">And, what we're interested in is the cardinality of the set.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1905000">And we're going to multiply it by two.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1909000">OK, so that's equal to two times; so there is a name for</span> <span m="1913000">this type of thing. We saw that when we were doing</span> <span m="1918000">sorting. Anybody remember the name?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1923000">It was very briefly. I don't expect anybody to</span> <span m="1928000">remember, but somebody might. Inversions: good,</span> <span m="1934000">OK, twice the number of inversions.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1938000">So, let's just do an example. So, let's say L_i is the list</span> <span m="1945000">with five elements. OK, I'll use characters for the</span> <span m="1957000">order just to keep things simple.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1967000">So, in this case phi of L_i is going to be twice the</span> <span m="1981000">cardinality of the set. So what we want to do is see</span> <span m="1992000">which things are out of order. So here, I look at E and C are</span> <span m="1998000">in this order, but C and E in that order.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2001000">So, those are out of order. So, that counts as one of my</span> <span m="2006000">elements, EC, and then, E and A,</span> <span m="2009000">A and E. OK, so those are out of order,</span> <span m="2016000">and then ED, DE, out of order,</span> <span m="2021000">and then EB, BE, those are out of order.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2028000">And now, I go C, A, C, A.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2033000">Those are in order, so it doesn't count.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2040000">CD, CD, CB, CB, so, nothing with C.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2048000">Then, A, D, A, D, those are in order,</span> <span m="2052000">A, B, A, B, those are in order. So then, DB,</span> <span m="2056000">BD, so BD. And that's the last one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2060000">So, that's my potential function, which is equal to,</span> <span m="2066000">therefore, ten, because the cardinality of the</span> <span m="2071000">set is five. I have five inversions,</span> <span m="2077000">OK, between the two lists. OK, so let's just check some</span> <span m="2084000">properties of this potential function.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2089000">The first one is notice that phi of L_i is greater than or</span> <span m="2097000">equal to zero for all i. The number of inversions might</span> <span m="2104000">be zero, but is never less than zero.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2107000">OK, it's always at least zero. So, that's one of the</span> <span m="2111000">properties that we normally have we are dealing with potential</span> <span m="2116000">functions. And, the other thing is,</span> <span m="2119000">well, what about phi of L0? Is that equal to zero?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2123000">Well, it depends upon what list they start with.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2127000">OK, so what's the initial ordering?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2131000">So, it's zero if they start with the same list.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2135000">Then there are no inversions. But, they might start with</span> <span m="2141000">different lists. We'll talk about different</span> <span m="2146000">lists later on, but let's say for now that it's</span> <span m="2150000">zero because they start with the same list.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2155000">That seems like a fair comparison.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2160000">OK, so we have this potential function now that's counting up,</span> <span m="2164000">how different are these two lists?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2167000">Intuitively, we're going to do is the more</span> <span m="2170000">differences there are in the list, the more we are going to</span> <span m="2174000">be able to have more stored up work than we can pay for it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2178000">That's the basic idea. So, the more that opt changes</span> <span m="2182000">the list, so it's not the same as ours, in some sense the more</span> <span m="2187000">we are going to be in a position as MTF to take advantage of that</span> <span m="2192000">difference in delivering up work for us to do.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2197000">And we'll see how that plays out.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2202000">So, let's first also make another observation.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2210000">So, how much does phi change from one transpose?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2219000">How much does phi change from one transpose?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2228000">So, basically that's asking, if you do a transpose,</span> <span m="2234000">what happens to the number of inversions?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2238000">So, what happens when a transposing is done?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2244000">What's going to happen to phi? What's going to happen to the</span> <span m="2251000">number of inversions? So, if I change,</span> <span m="2257000">it is less than n minus one, yes, if n is sufficiently</span> <span m="2263000">large, yes. OK, if I change,</span> <span m="2267000">so you can think about it here. Suppose I switch two of these</span> <span m="2274000">elements here. How much are things going to</span> <span m="2279000">change? Yeah, it's basically one or</span> <span m="2285000">minus one, OK, because a transpose creates or</span> <span m="2291000">destroys one inversion. So, if you think about it,</span> <span m="2297000">what if I change, for example,</span> <span m="2301000">C and A, the relationship of C and A to everything else in the</span> <span m="2309000">list is going to stay the same. The only thing,</span> <span m="2316000">possibly, that happens is that if they are in the same order</span> <span m="2321000">when I transpose them, I've created an inversion.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2326000">Or, if they were in the wrong order when I transpose them,</span> <span m="2331000">now they're in the right order. So therefore,</span> <span m="2335000">the change to the potential function is going to be plus or</span> <span m="2341000">minus two because we're counting twice the number of inversions.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2348000">OK, any questions about that? So, transposes don't change the</span> <span m="2354000">potential very much, just by one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2357000">It either goes up by two or down by two, just by one</span> <span m="2362000">inversion. So now, let's take a look at</span> <span m="2366000">how these two algorithms operate.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2386000">OK, so what happens when op i accesses x in the two lists?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2403000">What's going to be going on? To do that, let's define the</span> <span m="2407000">following sets.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2433000">Why do I keep doing that?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2514000">OK, so we're going to look at the, when we access x,</span> <span m="2517000">we are going to look at the two lists, and see what the</span> <span m="2521000">relationship is, so, based on things that come</span> <span m="2525000">before and after. So, I think a picture is very</span> <span m="2530000">helpful to understand what's going on here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2535000">OK, so let's let, so here's L_i minus one,</span> <span m="2539000">and we have our list, which I'll draw like this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2545000">And somewhere in there, we have x.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2550000">OK, and then we have L_i minus one star, which is opt's list,</span> <span m="2560000">OK, and he's got x somewhere else, or she.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2568000">OK, and so, what is this set? This is the set of Y that come</span> <span m="2579000">before x. So, that basically sets A and</span> <span m="2585000">B. OK, those things that come</span> <span m="2588000">before x in both. And, some of them,</span> <span m="2593000">the A's come before it in x, but come after it in,</span> <span m="2599000">come before it in A, but come after it in B.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2604000">OK, and similarly down here, what's this set?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2620000">That's A union C, good.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2622000">And this one? Duh.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2624000">Yeah, it better be C union D because I've got A union B over</span> <span m="2631000">there, and I've got x. So that better be everything</span> <span m="2637000">else. OK, and here is B union D.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2642000">OK, so those are the four sets that we're going to care about.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2651000">We're actually mostly going to care about these two sets.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2659000">OK, and we also know something about the r here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2666000">The position of x is going to be the rank in L_i minus one of</span> <span m="2675000">x. And here, this is our star.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2679000">It's just to the rank in L_i minus one star of x.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2684000">So, we know what these ranks are.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2687000">And what we're going to be interested in is,</span> <span m="2691000">in fact, characterizing the rank in terms of the sets.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2696000">OK, so what's the position of this?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2701000">Well, the rank, we have that r is equal to the</span> <span m="2709000">size of A. What's the size of B plus one?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2717000">OK, and r star is equal to the size of A plus the size of C</span> <span m="2728000">plus one. So, let's take a look at what</span> <span m="2734000">happens when these two algorithms do their thing.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2741000">So, when the access to x occurs, we move x to the front</span> <span m="2748000">of the list. OK, it goes right up to the</span> <span m="2753000">front. So, how many inversions are</span> <span m="2757000">created and destroyed? So, how many are created by</span> <span m="2763000">this? That's probably a,</span> <span m="2765000">how many inversions are created?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2793000">How many inversions are created?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2795000">So, we move x to the front. So what we are concerned about</span> <span m="2799000">is that anything that was in one of these sets that came,</span> <span m="2803000">where it's going to change in order versus down here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2807000">So, if I look in B, well, let's take a look at A.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2811000">OK, so A, those are the things that are in the same order in</span> <span m="2816000">both. So, everything that's in A,</span> <span m="2818000">when I move x to the front, each thing in A is going to</span> <span m="2822000">count for one more inversion. Does everybody see that?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2829000">So, I create a cardinality of A inversions.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2835000">And, we are going to destroy, well, everything in B came</span> <span m="2843000">before x in this list, and after x in this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2851000">But after we move x, they're in the right order.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2856000">So, I'm going to destroy B inversions, cardinality of B</span> <span m="2863000">inversions. OK, so that's what happens we</span> <span m="2868000">operate with move to front. We destroy.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2872000">We create A inversions and destroy B inversions,</span> <span m="2878000">OK, by doing this movement. OK, now, let's take a look at</span> <span m="2886000">what opt does. So, each transpose,</span> <span m="2889000">we don't know what opt does. He might move x this way or</span> <span m="2896000">that way. We don't know.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2898000">But each transpose, I opt, well,</span> <span m="2902000">we're going to be interested in how many inversions it creates,</span> <span m="2909000">and we already argued that it's going to create,</span> <span m="2914000">at most, one inversion per transpose.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2920000">So, he can go and create more inversions, OK?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2926000">So, let me write it over here. Thus --</span> <span m="2945000">-- the change in potential is going to be, at most,</span> <span m="2956000">twice, A minus B plus t_i. OK, so t_i, remember,</span> <span m="2966000">was the number of transposes that opt does on the i'th step</span> <span m="2979000">for the i'th operation. OK, so we're going to create</span> <span m="2989000">the change in potential is, at most, twice this function.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2996000">So, we are now going to look to see how we use this fact,</span> <span m="3007000">and these two facts, this fact and this fact,</span> <span m="3016000">OK, to show that opt can't be much better than MTF.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3026000">OK, good. The way we are going to do that</span> <span m="3033000">is look at the amortized cost of the I'th operation.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3038000">OK, what's MTF's amortized cost?</span> </p>
<p><span m="3041000">OK, and then we'll make the argument, which is the one you</span> <span m="3047000">always make that the amortized cost upper bound the true costs,</span> <span m="3053000">OK? But the amortized cost is going</span> <span m="3057000">to be easier to calculate. OK, so amortized cost is just C</span> <span m="3064000">hat, actually, let me make sure I have lots of</span> <span m="3069000">room here on the right, c_i hat, which is equal to the</span> <span m="3075000">true cost plus the change in potential.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3079000">OK, that's just the definition of amortized cost when given</span> <span m="3085000">potential functions, OK?</span> </p>
<p><span m="3089000">So, what is the cost of operation i, OK,</span> <span m="3096000">in this context here? OK, we accessed x there.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3105000">What's the cost of operation i? Two times the rank of x,</span> <span m="3116000">which is 2r. OK, so 2r, that part of it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3125000">OK, well, we have an upper bound on the change in</span> <span m="3133000">potential. That's this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3137000">OK, so that's two times the cardinality of A minus</span> <span m="3145000">cardinality of B plus t_i. OK, everybody with me?</span> </p>
<p><span m="3153000">Yeah? OK, I see lots of nods.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3157000">That's good. OK, that's equal to 2r plus two</span> <span m="3162000">of size of A minus, OK, I want to plug in for B,</span> <span m="3168000">and it turns out very nicely. I have an equation involving A,</span> <span m="3175000">B, and r. So, I get rid of the variable</span> <span m="3180000">size of B by just plugging that in.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3186000">OK, and so what do I plug in here?</span> </p>
<p><span m="3191000">What's B equal to? Yeah, r minus size of A minus</span> <span m="3198000">one. I wrote it the other way.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3203000">OK, and then plus t_i. OK, and this is since r is A</span> <span m="3211000">plus B plus one. OK, everybody with me still?</span> </p>
<p><span m="3217000">I'm just doing algebra. We've got to make sure we do</span> <span m="3224000">the algebra right. OK, so that's equal to,</span> <span m="3230000">let's just multiply all this out now and get 2r plus,</span> <span m="3237000">I have 2A here minus A. So, that's 4A.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3243000">And then, two times minus r is minus 2r.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3248000">Two times minus one is minus two.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3252000">Oh, but it's minus-minus two, so it's plus two.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3258000">OK, and then I have 2t_i. So, that's just algebra.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3264000">OK, so that's not bad. We've just got rid of another</span> <span m="3271000">variable. What variable did we get rid</span> <span m="3277000">of? r.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3278000">It didn't matter what the rank was as long as I knew what the</span> <span m="3286000">number of inversions was here. OK, so that's now equal to 4A</span> <span m="3294000">plus two plus 2t_i. And, that's less than or equal</span> <span m="3302000">to, I claim, four times r star plus t_i using our other fact.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3311000">Since r star is equal to the size of A plus the size of C,</span> <span m="3319000">plus one, then that's greater than or equal to the size of A</span> <span m="3328000">plus one. OK, if I look at this,</span> <span m="3335000">I'm basically looking at A. The fact that A,</span> <span m="3342000">what did I do here? If r star is greater than or</span> <span m="3351000">equal to A plus one, right, so therefore,</span> <span m="3358000">A plus one, good. Yeah, so this is basically less</span> <span m="3365000">than or equal to 4A plus four, which is four times A plus one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3369000">I probably should have put in another algebra step here,</span> <span m="3373000">OK, because if I can't verify it like this,</span> <span m="3376000">then I get nervous. This is basically,</span> <span m="3379000">at most, 4A plus four. That's four times A plus one,</span> <span m="3383000">and A plus one is less than or equal to r star.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3386000">And then, 2t_i is, at most, 4TI.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3390000">So, I've got this. Does everybody see where that</span> <span m="3403000">came from? But what is r star plus t_i?</span> </p>
<p><span m="3414000">What is r star plus t_i? What is it?</span> </p>
<p><span m="3424000">It's c_i star. That's just c_i star.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3433000">So, the amortized cost of i'th operation is,</span> <span m="3444000">at most, four times opt's cost. OK, that's pretty remarkable.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3456000">OK, so amortized cost of the i'th operation is just four</span> <span m="3464000">times opt's cost. Now, of course,</span> <span m="3468000">we have to now go through and analyze the total cost.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3475000">But this is now the routine way that we analyze things with a</span> <span m="3483000">potential function. So, the costs of MTF of S is</span> <span m="3492000">just the summation of the individual costs,</span> <span m="3501000">OK, by definition. And that is just the sum,</span> <span m="3510000">i equals one, to S of the amortized cost</span> <span m="3518000">plus, minus the change in potential.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3525000">OK, did I do this right? No, I put the parentheses in</span> <span m="3535000">the wrong place. Now I've got it right.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3541000">Good. I just missed a parenthesis.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3544000">OK, so this is, so in the past what I did was I</span> <span m="3548000">expressed the amortized cost as being equal to c_i plus the</span> <span m="3553000">change in potential. I'm just throwing these two</span> <span m="3557000">terms over to the other side and saying, what's the true cost in</span> <span m="3562000">terms of the amortized cost? OK, so I get c hat of i plus</span> <span m="3566000">phi sub L_i minus one minus phi of L_i, OK, by making that</span> <span m="3571000">substitution. OK, that's less than or equal</span> <span m="3576000">to since this is linear. Well, I know what the sum of</span> <span m="3581000">the amortized cost is. It's, at most,</span> <span m="3584000">4c_i star. So, the sum of them is,</span> <span m="3587000">at most, to that sum, I equals one to S of 4c_i star.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3592000">And then, as happens in all these things,</span> <span m="3596000">you get a telescope with these terms.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3601000">Every term is added in once and subtracted out once,</span> <span m="3608706">except for the ones at the limit.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3613542">So, I get plus phi of L_0 minus phi of L sub cardinality of S.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3622760">And now, this term is zero. And this term is greater than</span> <span m="3631222">or equal to zero. OK, so therefore this whole</span> <span m="3639468">thing is less than or equal to, well, what's that?</span> </p>
<p><span m="3647579">That's just four times opt's cost.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3653041">And so, we're four competitive. OK, this is amazing,</span> <span m="3660591">I think. It's not that hard,</span> <span m="3662739">OK, but it's quite amazing that just by doing a simple</span> <span m="3666956">heuristic, you're nearly as good as any omniscient algorithm</span> <span m="3671650">could possibly be. OK, you're nearly as good.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3675151">And, in fact, in practice,</span> <span m="3677141">this is a great heuristic. So, if ever you have things</span> <span m="3681358">like a hash table that you're actually seeing by chaining,</span> <span m="3685893">OK, often it's the case that if when you access the elements,</span> <span m="3690667">you're just bringing them up to the front of the list if it's an</span> <span m="3695679">unsorted list that you've put them into, just bring them up to</span> <span m="3700533">the front. You can easily save 30 to 40%</span> <span m="3705448">in run time for the accessing to the hash table because you will</span> <span m="3710767">be much more likely to find the elements inside.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3714736">Of course, it depends on the distribution and so forth,</span> <span m="3719295">for empirical matters, but the point is that you are</span> <span m="3723601">not going to be too far off from the ordering that an optimal</span> <span m="3728667">algorithm would do, optimal off-line algorithm:</span> <span m="3732551">I mean, amazing. OK: optimal off-line.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3737037">Now, it turns out that in the reading that we assigned,</span> <span m="3742276">so, we assigned you Sleator and Tarjan's original paper.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3748000">In that reading, they actually have a slightly</span> <span m="3759388">different model where they count transposes that move in excess</span> <span m="3775080">to element x towards the front of the list as free.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3789000">OK, so, and this basically models, so here's the idea is if</span> <span m="3794555">I actually have a linked list, and when I chase down,</span> <span m="3799536">once I find x, I can actually move x up to the</span> <span m="3803846">front with just a constant number of pointer operations to</span> <span m="3809306">splice it out and put it up to the front.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3814000">I don't actually have to transpose all way back down.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3816785">OK, so that's kind of the model that they use,</span> <span m="3819196">which is a more realistic model.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3820857">OK, I presented this argument because it's a little bit</span> <span m="3823750">simpler. OK, and the model is a little</span> <span m="3825732">bit simpler. But in our model,</span> <span m="3827285">they have, when you access something, you want to bring it</span> <span m="3830339">up to the front, or anything that you happen to</span> <span m="3832803">go across during that time, you could bring up to the front</span> <span m="3835910">essentially for free. This model is the splicing in,</span> <span m="3846000">splicing x in and out of L in constant time.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3857466">Then, MTF is, it turns out,</span> <span m="3864400">too competitive. It's within a factor of two of</span> <span m="3872288">optimal, OK, if you use that. And that's actually a good</span> <span m="3876487">exercise to work through. You could also go read about it</span> <span m="3880761">in the reading to understand this better, to look to see</span> <span m="3884958">where you would use those things.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3887401">You have to have another term representing the number of,</span> <span m="3891675">quote, "free" transposes. But it turns out that all the</span> <span m="3895796">math works out pretty much the same.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3898467">OK, let's see, another thing I promised you</span> <span m="3901673">is, what if, to look at the case, what if they don't start</span> <span m="3906023">with the same lists? OK, what if the two lists are</span> <span m="3914480">different when they start? Then, the potential function at</span> <span m="3925251">the beginning might be as big as what?</span> </p>
<p><span m="3933000">How big are the potential function start out as if the</span> <span m="3937997">lists are different? So, suppose we're starting out,</span> <span m="3942805">you have a list, and opt says,</span> <span m="3945538">OK, I'm going to start out by ordering my list according to</span> <span m="3951008">the sequence that I want to use, OK, and MTF orders it according</span> <span m="3956948">to the sequence it must use. What list is opt going to start</span> <span m="3962511">out with as an adversary? Yeah, it's going to pick the</span> <span m="3969900">reverse of what ever MTF starts out with, right,</span> <span m="3976447">because then, if he picks the reverse,</span> <span m="3981601">what's the number of inversions?</span> </p>
<p><span m="3985920">It's how many inversions in a reverse ordered list?</span> </p>
<p><span m="3994000">Yeah, n choose two, OK.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3996465">Is it n choose two, or n minus one choose two?</span> </p>
<p><span m="4001508">n minus one choose two, OK, inversions that you get</span> <span m="4007112">because it's basically a triangular number when you add</span> <span m="4013163">them up. But in any case,</span> <span m="4015853">it's order n^2, worst case.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4020000">So, what does that do to our analysis here?</span> </p>
<p><span m="4027029">It says that the cost of MTF of S is going to be,</span> <span m="4035064">well, this is no longer zero. This is now n^2.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4042596">OK, so we get that costs of MTF of S is, at most,</span> <span m="4050630">four times opt's thing plus order n^2, OK?</span> </p>
<p><span m="4059000">And, if we look at the definition, did we erase it</span> <span m="4071329">already? OK, this is still for</span> <span m="4078625">competitive, OK, since n^2 is constant as the</span> <span m="4089696">size of S goes to infinity. This is, once again,</span> <span m="4099283">sort of your notion of, what does it mean to be a</span> <span m="4102363">constant? OK, so as the size of the list</span> <span m="4104868">gets bigger, all we're doing is accessing whatever that number,</span> <span m="4108846">n, is of elements. That number doesn't grow with</span> <span m="4111863">the problem size, OK, even if it starts out as</span> <span m="4114752">some variable number, n.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4117000">OK, it doesn't grow with the problem size.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4122578">We still end up being competitive.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4127071">This is just the k that was in that definition of</span> <span m="4133603">competitiveness. OK, any questions?</span> </p>
<p><span m="4138229">Yeah? Well, so you could change the</span> <span m="4142761">cost model a little bit. Yeah.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4145523">And that's a good one to work out.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4148666">But if you say the cost of transposing, so,</span> <span m="4152666">the cost of transposing is probably moving two pointers,</span> <span m="4157904">approximately. No, one, three pointers.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4161523">So, suppose that the cost of, wow, that's a good exercise,</span> <span m="4166952">OK? Suppose the cost was three</span> <span m="4169714">times to do a transpose, was three times the cost of</span> <span m="4174571">doing an access, of following a pointer.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4180000">OK, how would that change the number here?</span> </p>
<p><span m="4183741">OK, good exercise, great exercise.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4186752">OK, hmm, good final question. OK, yes, it will affect the</span> <span m="4191863">constant here just as when we do the free transpose,</span> <span m="4196517">when we move things towards the front, that we consider those as</span> <span m="4202266">free, OK. Those operations end up</span> <span m="4206090">reducing the constant as well. OK, but the point is that this</span> <span m="4211545">constant is independent of the constant having to do with the</span> <span m="4217000">number of elements in the list. So that's a different constant.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4222636">So, this is a constant. OK, and so as with a lot of</span> <span m="4227181">these things, there's two things.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4231000">One is, there's the theory. So, theory here backs up</span> <span m="4234505">practice. OK, those practitioners knew</span> <span m="4237048">what they were doing, OK, without knowing what they</span> <span m="4240485">were doing. OK, so that's really good.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4243028">OK, and we have a deeper understanding that's led to,</span> <span m="4246603">as I say, many algorithms for things like, the important ones</span> <span m="4250727">are like paging. So, what's the comment page</span> <span m="4253682">replacement policy that people study, people have at most</span> <span m="4257532">operating systems? Who's done 6.033 or something?</span> </p>
<p><span m="4262000">Yeah, it's Least Recently Used, LRU.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4264272">People have heard of that, OK.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4266155">So, you can analyze LRU competitive, and show that LRU</span> <span m="4269597">is actually competitive with optimal page replacement under</span> <span m="4273363">certain assumptions. OK, and there are also other</span> <span m="4276480">things. Like, people do random</span> <span m="4278363">replacement algorithms, and there are a whole bunch of</span> <span m="4281805">other kinds of things that can be analyzed with the competitive</span> <span m="4285831">analysis framework. OK, so it's very cool stuff.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4288883">And, we are going to see more in recitation on Friday,</span> <span m="4292324">see a couple of other really good problems that are maybe a</span> <span m="4296090">little bit easier than this one, OK, definitely easier than this</span> <span m="4300181">one. OK, they give you hopefully</span> <span m="4305479">some more intuition about competitive analysis.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4311407">I also want to warn you about next week's problem set.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4318237">So, next week's problem set has a programming assignment on it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4327000">OK, and the programming assignment is mandatory,</span> <span m="4330676">meaning, well, all the problem sets are</span> <span m="4333649">mandatory as you know, but if you decide not to do a</span> <span m="4337639">problem there's a little bit of a penalty and then the penalties</span> <span m="4342568">scale dramatically as you stop doing problem sets.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4346401">But this one is mandatory-mandatory.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4350000">OK, you don't pass the class. You'll get an incomplete if you</span> <span m="4353823">do not do this programming assignment.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4356180">Now, I know that some people are less practiced with</span> <span m="4359430">programming. And so, what I encourage you to</span> <span m="4362169">do over the weekend is spent a few minutes and work on your</span> <span m="4365865">programming skills if you're not up to snuff in programming.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4369624">It's not going to be a long assignment, but if you don't</span> <span m="4373129">know how to read a file and write out a file,</span> <span m="4375932">and be able to write a dozen lines of code,</span> <span m="4378608">OK, if you are weak on that, this weekend would be a good</span> <span m="4382176">idea to practice reading in a text file.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4386000">It's going to be a text file. Read it in a text file,</span> <span m="4389571">decent manipulations, write out a text file,</span> <span m="4392524">OK? So, I don't want people to get</span> <span m="4394791">caught with this being mandatory and that not have time to finish</span> <span m="4399186">it because they are busy trying to learn how to program in short</span> <span m="4403513">order. I know some people take this</span> <span m="4405848">course without quite getting all the programming prerequisites.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4411000">Here's where you need it. Question?</span> </p>
<p><span m="4413964">No language limitations. Pick your language.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4417712">The answer will be written in, I think, Java,</span> <span m="4421548">and Eric has graciously volunteered to use Python for</span> <span m="4426082">his solution to this problem. We'll see whether he lives up</span> <span m="4431138">to that promise. You did already?</span> </p>
<p><span m="4433928">OK, and George wrote the Java solution.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4437241">And so, C is fine. Matlab is fine.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4440117">OK, what else is fine? Anything is fine.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4445000">Scheme is fine. Scheme is fine.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4447600">Scheme is great. OK, so any such things will be</span> <span m="4451587">just fine. So, we don't care what language</span> <span m="4455141">you program in, but you will have to do</span> <span m="4458434">programming to solve this problem.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4461295">OK, so thanks very much. See you next week.</span> </p>
