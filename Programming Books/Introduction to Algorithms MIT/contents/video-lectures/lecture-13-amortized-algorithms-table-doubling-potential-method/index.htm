<p><span m="10000">OK, good morning. So today we are going to,</span> <span m="13000">as I mentioned last week, we've started the part of the</span> <span m="17000">course where we are doing more things having to do with design</span> <span m="22000">than purely analysis. Today, we're actually going to</span> <span m="26000">do analysis, but it's the type of analysis that leads to really</span> <span m="32000">interesting design issues. And we're going to follow it up</span> <span m="38000">on Wednesday with an application of the methods we're going to</span> <span m="46000">learn today with a really interesting and practical</span> <span m="53000">problem. So we're talking today about</span> <span m="57000">amortized analysis. And I want to motivate this</span> <span m="64000">topic by asking the question, how large should a hash table</span> <span m="72000">be? So, how large should a hash</span> <span m="77000">table be? Any suggestions?</span> </p>
<p><span m="80000">You have got to make a hash table, how big should I make it?</span> </p>
<p><span m="90000">Let's say it's a simple hash table, resolving collisions with</span> <span m="98000">chaining. How big should it be?</span> </p>
<p><span m="103000">Twice as big as you need: OK, how big would that be?</span> </p>
<p><span m="110000">So, twice the number of elements, for example,</span> <span m="117000">OK. As I increase the size of a</span> <span m="122000">hash table, what happens to the search time?</span> </p>
<p><span m="130000">What happens to search time as I increase the size of the hash</span> <span m="134000">table? Yeah, but what does it,</span> <span m="136000">in general, do you? It decreases,</span> <span m="139000">right? OK, the bigger I make it,</span> <span m="141000">in fact, if I make it sufficiently large,</span> <span m="144000">then I essentially get a direct access table,</span> <span m="147000">and everything is worst-case, order one time.</span> </p>
<p><span m="152000">So in some sense, we'll get back to your answer</span> <span m="158000">in a minute. We should make it as large as</span> <span m="164000">possible, OK, so that the searching is cheap.</span> </p>
<p><span m="170000">The flipside of that is what? It takes a lot of space so I</span> <span m="178000">should make it as small as possible so as not to waste</span> <span m="185000">space. So I want it big,</span> <span m="190000">and the happy medium, as we've discussed in our</span> <span m="198000">analysis, is to make it order n size for n items,</span> <span m="206000">OK, because making it larger than order n,</span> <span m="213000">the payoff in search time is not worth the extra amount of</span> <span m="223000">space that you are paying. OK, or at least you can view it</span> <span m="231000">that way. OK, however,</span> <span m="234000">this begs the question, which is, how do I make it,</span> <span m="238000">if I start out with a hash table, and I don't know how many</span> <span m="244000">elements are going to be hashed into it?</span> </p>
<p><span m="249000">OK, how big should I make it? OK, so what if we don't know --</span> <span m="274000">-- in advance? OK, what if we don't know n?</span> </p>
<p><span m="279000">OK, so the solution to this problem turns out it's fairly</span> <span m="287000">elegant? It's a strategy called dynamic</span> <span m="293000">tables. OK, and the idea is that</span> <span m="298000">whenever the table gets too many elements in it,</span> <span m="306000">gets too full, OK, so the idea is --</span> <span m="326000">-- OK, and we say that says the table overflows,</span> <span m="330000">OK, we grow it and make a bigger table.</span> </p>
<p><span m="334000">So, for hashing, although there's going to be no</span> <span m="338000">point at which you could say that it overflows in the sense</span> <span m="344000">that it wouldn't be functional at least if it was done with</span> <span m="349000">chaining. There would be,</span> <span m="352000">by the way, if you were doing it with open addressing.</span> </p>
<p><span m="357000">But let's say with chaining, when it gets too big,</span> <span m="361000">say, as many elements as the size of the table,</span> <span m="366000">what we do is we grow the table.</span> </p>
<p><span m="371000">So, the way we do that as we allocate using,</span> <span m="376000">in a language like C, it's called Malloc,</span> <span m="382000">or in a language like Java called New, a larger table.</span> </p>
<p><span m="390000">So, we create a larger table. We move the items from the old</span> <span m="403000">table to the new. And then, we free the old</span> <span m="413000">table. So, let's do an example.</span> </p>
<p><span m="421000">So, let's say I have, over here, a table of size one,</span> <span m="425000">and it's empty to begin with. And I do an insert.</span> </p>
<p><span m="429000">So what I do is stick it in the table.</span> </p>
<p><span m="432000">It fits. OK, so here,</span> <span m="434000">I'm not going to do it with hashing.</span> </p>
<p><span m="437000">I'm just going to do it as if I just had a table that I was</span> <span m="442000">filling up with elements to abstract the problem.</span> </p>
<p><span m="446000">But it would work with hashing. It would work with any kind of</span> <span m="453000">fixed size data structure. I insert again,</span> <span m="458000">oops, doesn't fit. I get an overflow.</span> </p>
<p><span m="462000">OK, so what I do is I create a new, actually,</span> <span m="468000">I'm going to need a little more space than that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="473000">I create a new table of size two, doubling the size.</span> </p>
<p><span m="481000">And, I copy the old value into the new.</span> </p>
<p><span m="486000">I freed this one, and now I can insert item two.</span> </p>
<p><span m="493000">So, I do it again. I get another overflow.</span> </p>
<p><span m="499000">So now, I make a table of size four.</span> </p>
<p><span m="504000">I copied these guys in, and then I insert my number</span> <span m="511000">three. I do insert here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="516000">I do five. I guess I should be using ditto</span> <span m="521000">marks. That would be a lot smarter.</span> </p>
<p><span m="526000">Whoops, what am I doing? I overflow.</span> </p>
<p><span m="532000">And now, I make one of size eight, OK, copy these over,</span> <span m="540000">and now I can insert five. And I can do six,</span> <span m="547000">seven, etc., OK?</span> </p>
<p><span m="549000">Does everybody understand the basic idea?</span> </p>
<p><span m="555000">So, whenever I overflow, I'm going to create a table of</span> <span m="564000">twice the size. OK, so let's do a quick</span> <span m="570000">analysis of this. So, we have a sequence of n</span> <span m="579000">insertion operations. OK, what is the worst-case cost</span> <span m="589000">of one insert operation? What's the worst case for any</span> <span m="598000">one of these? Yeah, it's order n,</span> <span m="604000">whatever the overhead is of copying; if we counted it as</span> <span m="610000">one, it would be basically n or n plus one because we've got to</span> <span m="617000">copy all those. OK, so it's order n.</span> </p>
<p><span m="621000">So therefore, if I have n of those,</span> <span m="625000">so the worst-case cost of n inserts is equal to n times</span> <span m="631000">order n, which is order n^2.</span> </p>
<p><span m="644000">Any questions? Does that make sense?</span> </p>
<p><span m="654000">Raise hands.</span> </p>
<p><span m="675000">Yeah, not all of them can be worst-case, good.</span> </p>
<p><span m="679000">And in fact, this is totally wrong analysis.</span> </p>
<p><span m="684000">Just because one can be worst-case order n doesn't mean</span> <span m="689000">n are necessarily order n. OK, so this is totally wrong</span> <span m="695000">analysis. n inserts, in fact,</span> <span m="698000">take order n time in the worst case.</span> </p>
<p><span m="703000">OK, it doesn't take order n^2. So, the analysis is correct up</span> <span m="708000">to the point where we set the worst-case of one insert was</span> <span m="712000">order n. Therefore, that's the wrong</span> <span m="715000">step. OK, whenever you see bugs in</span> <span m="718000">proofs, you want to know, which step is the one that</span> <span m="722000">failed so you can make sure that you don't have a confusion</span> <span m="727000">there? So, let's do the proper</span> <span m="733000">analysis, OK? So let's let c_i be the cost of</span> <span m="743000">the i'th insert. OK, so that's equal to i,</span> <span m="752000">if i minus one is an exact power of two.</span> </p>
<p><span m="762000">And it's one otherwise. OK, so as I was going through</span> <span m="767000">here, it was only when I inserted something where the</span> <span m="772000">previous one had been the exact power of two,</span> <span m="776000">because that was my table size. That's when I got the overflow</span> <span m="783000">and had to do all that copying. And otherwise,</span> <span m="789000">the cost, for example, for inserting six,</span> <span m="793000">was just one. I just inserted it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="797000">Does everybody see that? So, let's actually make a</span> <span m="803000">little table here so we can see this a little bit more clearly.</span> </p>
<p><span m="811000">OK, so here's i, and in the size of the table at</span> <span m="816000">step i, and the cost at step i. OK, so let's see,</span> <span m="823000">the size of i, let's see, at step one it was</span> <span m="828000">one. At step two,</span> <span m="830000">it was two. And at step three,</span> <span m="833000">that's when, to get three in the table,</span> <span m="837000">we had to double the size here. So, this is four,</span> <span m="843000">and four, it fit. And then five,</span> <span m="846000">it had to bump up to eight. And then, six,</span> <span m="849000">it was eight. Seven, it was eight.</span> </p>
<p><span m="852000">Eight, it was eight. And nine, it bumps up to 16,</span> <span m="856000">16, etc. So that's the size.</span> </p>
<p><span m="859000">And let's take a look at what the cost was.</span> </p>
<p><span m="862000">So, the cost here was one, OK, to insert one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="866000">The cost here was, I had to copy one,</span> <span m="869000">and then insert one. So, the cost was two.</span> </p>
<p><span m="875000">Here, I had to copy two and insert one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="878000">So, the cost was three. Here, I had to just insert one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="884000">So, the cost was one. Here, I had to copy four and</span> <span m="889000">insert one. So, the cost was five.</span> </p>
<p><span m="892000">Excuse me? I think it is.</span> </p>
<p><span m="895000">Yeah, see, it's i cost. The cost for five is i,</span> <span m="899000">OK, is five if this is a power of two.</span> </p>
<p><span m="905000">OK, one, one, and now we paid nine,</span> <span m="907000">and then one again. So that's the cost we are</span> <span m="911000">paying. It's a little bit easier to see</span> <span m="915000">what the costs are if I break them down.</span> </p>
<p><span m="918000">OK, so let's just redraw this as two values because there is</span> <span m="923000">always the cost for inserting the one thing that I want to</span> <span m="928000">insert. And now, the residual amount</span> <span m="932000">that I have to pay is I have to pay one here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="935000">I've got to pay two additional, four additional,</span> <span m="938000">eight additional. That makes the pattern a little</span> <span m="942000">bit easier to see. OK, this is the cost of copying</span> <span m="945000">versus the cost of just doing the actual insert,</span> <span m="949000">OK? Now, if you're taking notes,</span> <span m="951000">leave some space here because I'm going to come back to this</span> <span m="955000">table later. OK, so leave a little bit of</span> <span m="958000">space because I'm going to come back and add some more things at</span> <span m="963000">there at a later time. OK, so, I can then just add up</span> <span m="969000">the cost of n inserts. That's just the sum,</span> <span m="974000">I equals one to n of c_i, which is equal to,</span> <span m="980000">well, by this analysis it is essentially n because that's</span> <span m="987000">what this thing adds up to plus I just have to add the powers of</span> <span m="995000">two up to but not exceeding whatever my n was.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1002000">So, if I do my algebra properly there, that's up to the floor of</span> <span m="1010000">log n minus one, OK, of two to the J.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1015000">So, I'm just adding up all the powers of two up to that aren't</span> <span m="1023000">going to exceed my n. And, this is what type of</span> <span m="1029000">series? That's geometric.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1032000">That's geometric, so it is bounded by its largest</span> <span m="1038000">term. Its largest term is two to the</span> <span m="1042000">ceiling; it's dominated by its largest term,</span> <span m="1047000">two to the ceiling of log n minus one, which is,</span> <span m="1052000">at most, n. OK, and then all the other</span> <span m="1058000">terms at up to, at most, n.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1061000">So this is actually less than or equal to 3n,</span> <span m="1067000">which is order n as we want it to show.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1071000">OK, that's algebra. OK, so, thus,</span> <span m="1077000">the average cost per insert is theta of n over n,</span> <span m="1085000">which is theta one. So, the average cost of an</span> <span m="1092000">insert is order one, which is what we would like it</span> <span m="1101000">to be especially if we're building hash tables.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1110000">Even though sometimes you have to pay a big price with</span> <span m="1114000">amortized over the previous insertions that we've done,</span> <span m="1118000">so that the overall cost of n operations is order n.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1122000">And that's the notion of amortized analysis,</span> <span m="1126000">OK, that if I look at a sequence of operations,</span> <span m="1130000">I can spread the cost out over a whole bunch of operations,</span> <span m="1135000">so that the average cost is order n.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1139000">So, if we sort of summarize that, OK, OK,</span> <span m="1147000">with basically an amortized analysis, we analyze a sequence</span> <span m="1160000">of operations to show that the average cost per operation is</span> <span m="1174000">small, even though one operation, or several,</span> <span m="1184000">even, may be expensive. OK, there's no probability.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1199000">Even though we're doing it with averages, there's no probability</span> <span m="1205000">going on. OK, what you do probability,</span> <span m="1208000">and you are looking at means, there's averages.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1213000">OK, here's average, but there's no probability</span> <span m="1217000">going on. It's average performance in the</span> <span m="1221000">worst case because n operations take me a constant amount of</span> <span m="1227000">time per operation in the worst case.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1231000">n operations take me order n time.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1236000">OK, each operation takes order one time, OK,</span> <span m="1242000">but it's amortized over the n operations, OK?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1249000">Yeah, question? Yes.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1252000">Yes, yes, you can mix, but you don't have to.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1260000">Yeah, but the point is that the basic amortized analysis is</span> <span m="1266000">actually saying something very strong.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1270000">It's giving you worst-case bounds, but over a sequence as</span> <span m="1276000">opposed to looking at each individual element of the</span> <span m="1281000">sequence. Now, there are three types of</span> <span m="1285000">amortized arguments that appear in the literature.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1292000">Maybe there are more. At one point,</span> <span m="1295000">there were two. And then, a third one was</span> <span m="1299000">developed. So, maybe there's a fourth.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1303000">The first one is an aggregate, what's called an aggregate</span> <span m="1309000">analysis. And this is what we just saw,</span> <span m="1313000">OK, where basically you just analyze, what do the n</span> <span m="1319000">operations take? OK, and then we're going to see</span> <span m="1328000">two more today. One is called an accounting</span> <span m="1336000">argument, and the other is a potential argument.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1345000">These two are more precise because they allocate specific</span> <span m="1356000">amortized costs to each operation.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1365000">So, one of the things about the aggregate analysis is that you</span> <span m="1369000">can't really say what the amortized cost of a single</span> <span m="1373000">operation is easily. You can in this case.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1377000">You can say it's order one, OK?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1380000">But, in the accounting and potential arguments,</span> <span m="1383000">it gives you a much more precise way of characterizing</span> <span m="1387000">what an amortized cost of a particular operation is.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1391000">So, let's pitch in and look at the accounting method as our</span> <span m="1396000">first method. So, these we're going to go</span> <span m="1399000">through the exact same example. In some sense,</span> <span m="1402000">this example, the easiest argument to make is</span> <span m="1405000">the aggregate analysis. OK, so we're going get into</span> <span m="1409000">arguments that, in some sense,</span> <span m="1412000">see more complicated. But it turns out that these</span> <span m="1417000">methods are more powerful in many circumstances.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1423000">OK, and so I want to do it in a simple situation where you have</span> <span m="1429000">some sort of appreciation of the fact that you can look at any</span> <span m="1436000">particular problem and approach it from different ways.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1442000">OK, so the accounting method is putting yourself in the position</span> <span m="1448000">of a financial accountant. So what you do is we are going</span> <span m="1459000">to charge the i'th operation a fictitious amortized cost.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1473000">We'll call it c hat sub i, where we are going to use the</span> <span m="1479000">abstraction that $1 pays for one unit of work.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1484000">There's Time manipulating the data structure or whatever.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1491000">OK, so the idea is you charge the cost.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1495000">You say, this operation will cost you $5 or whatever.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1503000">OK, and that phi is consumed to perform the operation,</span> <span m="1514000">but there may be some unused part.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1521000">So, if there's any unused amount, it's going to be stored</span> <span m="1533000">in the bank for use by later operations.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1544000">So the idea is that if the phi that is being paid,</span> <span m="1549000">the c_i hat phi, isn't sufficient to pay for</span> <span m="1554000">performing the operation, then you take money out of the</span> <span m="1561000">bank to pay for it. OK, and so you don't get</span> <span m="1565000">arrested, what's the property that you've got to have?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1569000">You've got to have the bank balance.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1572000">What about the bank balance? What mathematical fact has to</span> <span m="1576000">hold the bank balance? Yeah, it better be greater than</span> <span m="1580000">or equal to zero, right?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1582000">Most people are familiar with that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1586000">So, the bank balance must not go negative.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1590000">In other words, the amortized costs minus the</span> <span m="1595000">costs of the operations up to that point have to always be</span> <span m="1601000">enough to pay for all the operations that you're doing.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1606000">Otherwise, you're borrowing on the future.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1611000">In amortized analysis, we don't borrow on the future,</span> <span m="1616000">at least not on the simple ones that we are doing here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1624000">OK, so that means we must have that the sum,</span> <span m="1631000">I equals one to n of c_i, the true costs,</span> <span m="1639000">therefore, if the balance is not going to ever go negative,</span> <span m="1649000">must be bounded above by the amortized costs for all n.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1661000">OK, for the bank balance not to go negative, if I add up the</span> <span m="1665000">true costs, it's got to be the case that I can always pay for</span> <span m="1669000">them. This is what I'm charging.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1671000">This is what it actually costs me.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1674000">So, it better be the case that whatever I've actually had to</span> <span m="1678000">pay to operate on that data structure, that's what this is,</span> <span m="1682000">better be covered by the amount that I've been charging people</span> <span m="1687000">for the use of that data structure up to that point.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1692000">And that's got to be true for all n.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1695000">But notice that this now gives me a way of charging a</span> <span m="1699000">particular operation a certain amount.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1703000">So, the total amortized costs provide an upper bound on the</span> <span m="1708000">total true costs. Total amortized costs are an</span> <span m="1715000">upper bound on the true costs. Any question about this?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1725000">That we'll do the example of the dynamic table using this</span> <span m="1734000">methodology. OK, so, back to the dynamic</span> <span m="1741000">table. OK, so what we're going to do</span> <span m="1748000">in this case is we're going to charge an amortized cost of $3</span> <span m="1759000">for the i'th insert for all i. And the idea is that $1 is</span> <span m="1771000">going to pay for an immediate insert, and $2 is going to be</span> <span m="1785000">stored for doubling the table. And, it needs to be expanded.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1800000">When the table doubles, of the stored dollars,</span> <span m="1810000">we'll use one dollar to move a recent item, I'll call it,</span> <span m="1824000">and one dollar we'll move an old item.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1834000">So, let's do the example. So, imagine that I'm in this</span> <span m="1842000">situation where I have a table of size eight,</span> <span m="1849000">and I just doubled my table. So I have four items of the</span> <span m="1857000">table. What I'm going to do is have no</span> <span m="1863000">dollars in my table. So, along comes an insertion of</span> <span m="1871000">item number five. I charge $3 for it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1876000">$1 lets me put the item in the table, and I have $2 left over.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1883000">So let me store those $2 in the slot corresponding to where that</span> <span m="1891000">item is. Now, item six comes in.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1894000">Once again, $1, charge $3, $1 is paid for the</span> <span m="1898000">insert, $2 left over, I'm going to play $2.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1902000">Let me put it down there, and so forth.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1905000">The next one comes in, $2, $2 leftover,</span> <span m="1908000">and now the ninth item comes in.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1911000">So, I double the size of my table.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1928000">OK, and now I copy all of these guys and to all of these here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1933000">And what happens? Look at that:</span> <span m="1935000">I've got $8, and I've got eight items that</span> <span m="1939000">have to be copied. Perfect.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1941000">OK, so one of these dollars pays for one of the ones that</span> <span m="1946000">was inserted in the last round, and one of them pays for an old</span> <span m="1951000">one. OK, and so, I copy them in,</span> <span m="1955000">and now, none of those guys have any money.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1960000">And the ninth guy comes in: he has $2 left over.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1965000">And then, we keep going on. OK, so you see that by that</span> <span m="1970000">argument, if I charge everybody $3, OK, I can always handle all</span> <span m="1977000">of the table doubling, the charges for the table</span> <span m="1981000">doubling because the inductive invariant that I've maintained</span> <span m="1988000">is that after it doubles, there's nothing in the bank</span> <span m="1993000">account. And now, I put in $2.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1997000">Well then, I can pay, and I'm now left in the same</span> <span m="2001000">situation. OK, and it's the case that the</span> <span m="2004000">bank balance never goes negative.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2006000">So that's a really important invariant to verify.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2021000">And so, therefore, the sum of the true costs,</span> <span m="2026000">or the amortized costs, upper bound the sum of the true</span> <span m="2033000">costs. And, since the sum of the</span> <span m="2037000">amortized cost, here, is, if I go i equals one</span> <span m="2043000">to n, OK, this is 3n. So, the point is,</span> <span m="2049000">now I bounded the sum of the true costs by 3n.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2056000">OK, so let's go back to this table here, and look to see what</span> <span m="2065000">happens, OK, if I put in c_i hat, and the bank balance.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2075000">OK, so in fact, so the first thing I do is</span> <span m="2083000">insert; I charge $3, right, and I do an insert.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2093000">How much do I have left? I'm going to have $2.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2101000">It turns out I'm actually going to charge $2 and have only $1</span> <span m="2107000">left. OK, so I'm actually going to</span> <span m="2110000">under charge the first guy. I'm going to show you that it</span> <span m="2116000">works if I charge everybody $3. Except the first guy:</span> <span m="2121000">I charge $2. I can actually save a little</span> <span m="2125000">bit on number one. OK, that for this guy I'm going</span> <span m="2130000">to charge $3. OK, what's the size of my bank</span> <span m="2136000">balance when I'm done? Well, I have to copy one guy.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2142000">He's all paid for, so I have $2 left.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2147000">OK, people with me? OK, the next guy:</span> <span m="2151000">I charge $3. Actually, I'm going to charge</span> <span m="2156000">all these guys $3. OK, so here now I basically get</span> <span m="2162000">to, I've got a table of size four.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2166000">So, I basically have, I have to copy,</span> <span m="2169000">oh, when I insert the third guy, I've got to copy two guys.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2174000">That'll use up that, so I'll have only $2 left in</span> <span m="2179000">the table after I've inserted him.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2182000">OK, now I insert the fourth guy, OK, and that's a good one</span> <span m="2187000">because now I've built up a balance here of $4 because I</span> <span m="2192000">didn't have to copy anybody. OK, now I insert the fifth guy.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2201000">I've got to copy four items. So that expends that balance.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2210000">I have, then, two left.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2214000">OK, and then here basically I add two to it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2220000">And then at this point, I use it all up and go back to</span> <span m="2229000">two, etc. OK, so you see one of the</span> <span m="2233000">things I want you to notice is I could have charged three here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2238000">And then I would've had an extra dollar lying around</span> <span m="2242000">throughout here. It wouldn't have mattered.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2245000">It still would be upper bounded by 3n.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2248000">OK, so the idea is that different schemes for charging</span> <span m="2252000">amortized costs can work. They don't all have to be the</span> <span m="2256000">same. It's not like when you do in</span> <span m="2259000">amortized analysis that there is one scheme that will work.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2263000">I could have charged $4 to everybody.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2265000">And it would have worked. But it turns out,</span> <span m="2268000">I couldn't have charged two dollars for everybody.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2271000">If I charged $2 for everybody, my balance would go negative,</span> <span m="2275000">OK? My balance would go negative,</span> <span m="2277000">but I can charge three dollars, and that will work.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2282000">OK, four, five, six, I could charge that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2284000">The bound that I would get would be simply a looser bound.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2288000">Instead of it being less than or equal to 3n,</span> <span m="2291000">it would be less than or equal to 4n or 5n, or what have you.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2295000">But if I tried to do 2n, it wouldn't have worked because</span> <span m="2299000">I wouldn't have enough money left to copy everything.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2302000">What would happen is I would have only $1 in this,</span> <span m="2305000">and then when it came time to table double,</span> <span m="2308000">I would need to copy eight guys.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2310000">And I'd only have built up a bank account of $4,</span> <span m="2313000">sorry, if I charged $2 and had $1 left over.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2318000">OK, so to actually make these things work out,</span> <span m="2322000">you have to play a little bit, OK, see what works,</span> <span m="2327000">see what doesn't work. OK, no algorithmic formulas for</span> <span m="2333000">algorithm design. OK, good.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2335000">In the book, you can read about table</span> <span m="2339000">contraction. What happens when you start</span> <span m="2343000">deleting elements? Now you want to make the table</span> <span m="2346000">be smaller. Now, you have to be very</span> <span m="2349000">careful because unless you put, who remembers from physics,</span> <span m="2352000">hysteresis? Vaguely?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2353000">A couple people? OK, you have to worry about</span> <span m="2356000">hysteresis. OK, if you're not careful,</span> <span m="2358000">if whenever it gets to be less than a power of two,</span> <span m="2362000">you go in the half, you can find that you're</span> <span m="2364000">thrashing. So, you need to make it so that</span> <span m="2367000">there is some memory in the system so that you only collapse</span> <span m="2371000">after you've done a sufficient number of deletions,</span> <span m="2374000">OK, and so forth. And the book has analysis of</span> <span m="2379000">the more general case. OK, so any questions about the</span> <span m="2383000">accounting method? Accounting method is really</span> <span m="2386000">very cute, OK, very cute.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2388000">And, it's the one most students prefer to do,</span> <span m="2391000">OK? They usually hate the next one</span> <span m="2394000">until they learn it. Once they learn it,</span> <span m="2396000">they say, ooh, that's cool.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2400000">OK, but to start out with, it takes a little bit more</span> <span m="2404000">intestinal fortitude, OK?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2407000">But it's amazing. Good potential arguments are</span> <span m="2411000">really sweet. And we are going to see one</span> <span m="2415000">next time, so you'll definitely want to review and make sure you</span> <span m="2420000">understand it before Wednesday's lecture because Wednesday's</span> <span m="2426000">lecture, we're going to assume we understand potential method.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2432000">OK, so let's do, enough advertisement.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2437000">I think the potential method is one of the beautiful results in</span> <span m="2443000">algorithmic analysis, OK, just beautiful result,</span> <span m="2448000">beautiful set of techniques. OK, and it's also,</span> <span m="2452000">just in terms of, I mean, what do you aspire:</span> <span m="2457000">to be a bookkeeper or to be a physicist?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2462000">OK, so, the idea is we don't want to be bankers.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2470000">We want to be physicists.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2484000">And so, this bank account, we are going to say about the</span> <span m="2488000">potential energy of the dynamics that that we are analyzing.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2492000">OK, because, why?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2494000">It delivers up work just like a spring does, for example,</span> <span m="2498000">OK, when you study potential energy, or putting something up</span> <span m="2502000">high and having gravity pull it down.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2505000">We convert dynamic to potential, and that's exactly</span> <span m="2509000">what we're going to be doing here, and it's similar</span> <span m="2513000">mathematics except that in our case it turns out to be discrete</span> <span m="2518000">mathematics rather than continuous math for most of it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2524000">So here's the framework for the potential method.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2534000">So, we start with some data structure, D_0,</span> <span m="2543000">and operation i transforms D_(i - 1) into D_i.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2555000">So, we view the operation on the data structure as a mapping,</span> <span m="2560000">mapping one data structure to another data structure,</span> <span m="2565000">the one from before to the one after.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2568000">OK, already it's nicely mathematical.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2571000">OK, and of course, the costs of operation i</span> <span m="2575000">remains at c_i.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2594000">And, now what we are going to do is define the potential</span> <span m="2606000">function, phi, which maps the set of data</span> <span m="2615000">structures into the reals. So, associated with every data</span> <span m="2626000">structure, now, is a potential,</span> <span m="2631000">OK, a real-valued potential, often integer potential such</span> <span m="2640000">that phi of D_0 is equal to zero.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2646000">So, the initial potential is zero, and phi of D_i is greater</span> <span m="2651000">than or equal to zero for all i. So, potential can never be</span> <span m="2656000">nonnegative, just like the bank account because the potential is</span> <span m="2662000">essentially representing the bank account,</span> <span m="2665000">if you will, in the accounting method.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2669000">OK, so we always want the potential to be nonnegative.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2675000">Now, actually, there are times where you use</span> <span m="2677000">potential functions where you violate both of these</span> <span m="2680000">properties. There's some really interesting</span> <span m="2683000">potential arguments which don't violate like these,</span> <span m="2686000">but for the simple ones we're going to be doing in this class,</span> <span m="2690000">we'll just assume that these tend to be true.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2692000">OK, but we will actually see some times where phi of D_0</span> <span m="2696000">isn't zero, it doesn't matter. OK, but generally this is what</span> <span m="2700000">we are going to assume in the type of potential function</span> <span m="2703000">argument that we are going to be doing.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2707000">OK, so I just want to let you know that there are bigger,</span> <span m="2712000">there is a bigger space of potential function arguments</span> <span m="2718000">than the one that I'm showing you here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2722000">OK, so then, under this circumstance,</span> <span m="2725000">we define the amortized cost c_i hat with respect to phi as,</span> <span m="2731000">and this is one of these formulas that if you can't</span> <span m="2736000">remember it, definitely put it down on your crib sheet for the</span> <span m="2742000">final. OK, so c_i hat is equal to c_i</span> <span m="2751000">plus phi of D_i minus phi of D_i minus one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2761000">OK, so this is the change in potential difference.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2772000">And, let's call it delta phi i for shorthand.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2782000">OK, and let's see what it means to have --</span> <span m="2803000">-- in the different circumstances.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2808000">So, if delta of phi i is greater than zero,</span> <span m="2815000">OK, so if this is greater than zero, then what's the</span> <span m="2823000">relationship between c_i hat and c_i?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2831000">This is greater than zero. Yeah, c_i hat is then greater</span> <span m="2839000">than c_i, OK? Then, c_i hat is greater than</span> <span m="2845000">c_i. And what does that mean?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2850000">That means when I do operation I, I charged more than it cost</span> <span m="2859000">me to do the operation. So, the extra amount that I</span> <span m="2868000">charged beyond what I actually used is being put into the bank,</span> <span m="2878000">OK, is being stored as potential energy.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2884000">So, op I stores work in the data structure for later.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2895000">Similarly, if delta phi i is less than zero,</span> <span m="2902000">then c_i hat is less than c_i. And so, the data structure</span> <span m="2913000">delivers up work --</span> <span m="2932000">-- to help pay for op I, OK, for operation I.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2943000">So, if it's less than zero, that means that my change in</span> <span m="2948000">potential, that means my bank account went down as a result,</span> <span m="2954000">and so therefore, what happens was the data</span> <span m="2958000">structure provided work to be done in order,</span> <span m="2963000">because the true cost was bigger than the amortized cost.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2970000">So, if you think about it, the difference between looking</span> <span m="2973000">at it from the potential function point of view versus</span> <span m="2977000">the accounting point of view, the accounting point of view,</span> <span m="2981000">you sort of say, here is what my amortized cost</span> <span m="2984000">will be. Now let me analyze my bank</span> <span m="2986000">account, make sure it never went negative.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2989000">In some sense, in the potential function</span> <span m="2992000">argument, you're saying, here's what my bank account is</span> <span m="2996000">all the time. Now let me analyze what the</span> <span m="3001000">amortized costs are. So, that's sort of the</span> <span m="3006000">difference in approaches. One is you are sort of</span> <span m="3012000">specifying the bank account. The other, you're specifying</span> <span m="3019000">the amortized costs. So, we look at the,</span> <span m="3024000">why is it that this is a reasonable way to proceed?</span> </p>
<p><span m="3032000">Well, let's look at the total amortized cost of n operations.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3041000">OK, that's just the sum, i equals one to n of c_i hat.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3049000">That's the total amortized cost.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3053000">And that's equal to, but substitution,</span> <span m="3059000">just substitute c_i hat for this formula.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3067000">OK, so that's c_i plus phi of D_i minus phi of D_i minus one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3084000">OK, and that's equal to c_i. And now, what happens when I</span> <span m="3096000">sum up these terms? What happens when some of these</span> <span m="3101000">terms? What's the mathematical term we</span> <span m="3105000">use? It telescopes.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3107000">OK, every term on the left is added in once when it's I,</span> <span m="3113000">and subtract it out when it's I minus one, except for the first</span> <span m="3120000">and last terms. The term for n is only added</span> <span m="3128000">in, and the term for zero is only subtracted out.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3136000">OK, so that's because it telescopes.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3143000">OK, so this term is what? What property do we know of</span> <span m="3152000">this? It's greater than or equal to</span> <span m="3158000">zero. And this one equals zero.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3162000">So, therefore, this is greater than or equal</span> <span m="3168000">to c_i. And thus, the amortized costs</span> <span m="3173000">are an upper bound on the true costs, which is what we want.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3182000">Some of the amortized costs is an upper bound up on the sum of</span> <span m="3186000">the true costs. OK, but here,</span> <span m="3188000">the way that we define the amortized costs was by first</span> <span m="3191000">defining the potential function. OK, so the potential function</span> <span m="3195000">is sort of, as I said, the difference between the</span> <span m="3199000">accounting and the potential method is, do you specify the</span> <span m="3203000">bank account or do you specify the cost?</span> </p>
<p><span m="3205000">OK, do you specify the potential energy at any point,</span> <span m="3209000">or do you specify the cost at any point?</span> </p>
<p><span m="3213000">OK, but in any case, you get, this bound,</span> <span m="3218000">also this math is nicer math. I like telescopes.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3224000">OK, so the amortized costs upper bound the true costs.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3231000">OK, let's do table doubling over here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3260000">So, to analyze this, we have to define our</span> <span m="3264000">potential. OK, if anybody can guess this</span> <span m="3268000">off the top of their head, they're better than I am.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3275000">I struggled with this for probably easily a couple hours</span> <span m="3282000">to get it right, OK, because I'm not too smart.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3288000">OK, that's a potential function I'm going to use,</span> <span m="3295000">OK, 2i minus two to the ceiling of log i.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3302000">And, we're going to assume that two to the ceiling of log of</span> <span m="3307000">zero is equal to zero, because that's what it is in</span> <span m="3313000">the limit. For log of zero,</span> <span m="3315000">this becomes minus infinity, so, two to the minus infinity</span> <span m="3321000">is zero. So, that's just going to be a</span> <span m="3325000">mathematical convenience. Assume that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3330000">OK, so where did I get this from?</span> </p>
<p><span m="3332000">I played around. I looked at that sequence that</span> <span m="3335000">I have erased and I said, OK, because reversing,</span> <span m="3338000">there are some problems for which defining a potential</span> <span m="3341000">function is fairly easy. But, defining the amortized</span> <span m="3345000">costs is hard, OK, to define the accounting.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3347000">So, for this one, the accounting method is,</span> <span m="3350000">I would say, an easier method to use.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3353000">However, I'm going to show you that you still can do it with</span> <span m="3357000">potential method if you come up with the right potential.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3362000">So, intuitively, this is basically what's left</span> <span m="3367000">in the bank account at the I'th operation because I've put in 2i</span> <span m="3374000">things into the bank, and I've subtracted out this</span> <span m="3380000">many, essentially, from table doublings,</span> <span m="3384000">OK, up to that point, OK?</span> </p>
<p><span m="3387000">So, first let's observe, what is phi of D_0?</span> </p>
<p><span m="3394000">Zero. So, that's good.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3396000">And, the phi of D_i is greater than or equal to zero.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3403000">Why is that?</span> </p>
<p><span m="3418000">Why is that?</span> </p>
<p><span m="3431000">So, what's the biggest that ceiling of log i could be?</span> </p>
<p><span m="3440000">Ceiling of log i is either log i or log i quantity plus one,</span> <span m="3450000">OK? So, the biggest it is,</span> <span m="3454000">is log i plus one. If it's log i plus one,</span> <span m="3460000">two to the log i plus one, it's just 2i.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3465000">That's the biggest it could be, right?</span> </p>
<p><span m="3470000">So, two, the log of i, plus one, is just,</span> <span m="3475000">let's do it the other way, is i times two,</span> <span m="3481000">OK, i for that part, two for that part.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3488000">OK, so that the biggest it could be.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3492000">OK, or it's just log of i. So, either this is going to be</span> <span m="3500000">2i minus i or 2i minus 2i. In either case,</span> <span m="3505000">it's bigger than zero, OK?</span> </p>
<p><span m="3510000">So, those are the two properties I need for this to be</span> <span m="3514000">a well-defined potential function.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3516000">Now, that doesn't say that the amortized costs are going to be</span> <span m="3521000">satisfied the property that things are going to be cheap,</span> <span m="3525000">OK, that I'm going to be able to do my analysis and get the</span> <span m="3530000">kind of bounds I want. But, it sets up to say,</span> <span m="3533000">yes, I've satisfied the syntax of having a proper potential</span> <span m="3538000">function. So, let's just do a quick</span> <span m="3543000">example here just to see what this means.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3547000">So, imagine that I am in the situation where I have eight,</span> <span m="3554000">did I do that right, OK, yeah, eight slots,</span> <span m="3559000">and say six of them are full. So then, phi by this is going</span> <span m="3566000">to be 2i. That's two times six minus two</span> <span m="3571000">to the 2i. What's that?</span> </p>
<p><span m="3575000">Sorry, minus two to the ceiling of log i.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3581000">So, i is six, right, so log of i is log of</span> <span m="3586000">six. The ceiling of it is three.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3590000">So, that's minus 2^3, which is eight.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3595000">So, that's 12 minus eight. That's four.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3602000">And if you think about this in the accounting method,</span> <span m="3605875">these would be zeros, and these would be twos,</span> <span m="3609228">right, for the accounting method if we do the same thing,</span> <span m="3613401">because this is halfway through, right,</span> <span m="3616233">all zeros, and that we add two for each one that we're going</span> <span m="3620629">in. So, I function is,</span> <span m="3622194">in fact, telling me what the actual cost is.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3625399">OK, everybody with me? OK, so that's what we mean by</span> <span m="3629199">this particular potential function.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3633000">OK, so now let's add up the amortized cost of the i'th</span> <span m="3637274">insert.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3669000">OK, so that's the amortized cost of the i'th insert,</span> <span m="3674190">just by definition. OK, and now that's equal to,</span> <span m="3678973">well, what is c_i? Do we still have that written</span> <span m="3683756">down somewhere, or have we erased that at this</span> <span m="3688336">point? I think we erased it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3692000">Well, we can write it down again.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3697480">It is i if i minus one is an exact power of two.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3705530">And, it's one otherwise. That's c_i.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3711524">That's this term, plus, and now phi of D_i:</span> <span m="3718718">so, what is that? phi of D_i is this business,</span> <span m="3730830">2i minus two ceiling of log i minus 2i minus one minus two</span> <span m="3746771">ceiling of log of I minus one. OK, so that's the amortized</span> <span m="3759634">cost. That's a nice,</span> <span m="3762192">pretty formula, right?</span> </p>
<p><span m="3765019">OK, let's hope it simplifies a little.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3770000">OK, so that's equal to, well, we have the i and the one</span> <span m="3777269">here, if, etc., that business,</span> <span m="3781173">plus, OK, well, we have some things we can</span> <span m="3786692">cancel here, right? So here, we have 2i minus 2i.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3796662">That cancels. And then we have what's left</span> <span m="3804668">over here is a minus two. So, that's a plus two.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3813846">And now, I have minus this term plus this term.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3824000">That's a lot prettier. OK, it's still a mess.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3828049">We've got to case analysis. Why is it suggestive of a case</span> <span m="3833294">analysis? We have a case.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3835503">OK, so let's do a case analysis.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3851000">OK, so case one, I minus one is an exact power</span> <span m="3857966">of two. So then, c_i hat is equal to,</span> <span m="3863538">well, c_i is now just i. That's that case.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3869887">And then we have the rest there, plus two,</span> <span m="3876234">minus two, ceiling of log i minus two ceiling of log of i</span> <span m="3884903">minus one. OK, and that's equal to i plus</span> <span m="3893089">two. Well, let's see.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3896482">If I minus one is an exact power of two,</span> <span m="3903098">what is this term? i minus one is an exact power</span> <span m="3912236">of two. Plus, thank you,</span> <span m="3916388">sorry about that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3933000">It's good to have students, let me say, because,</span> <span m="3936916">boy, my math is so bad. This is actually why I end up</span> <span m="3941250">being a pretty good theoretician is because I don't ever trust</span> <span m="3946333">what I've written down. And so, I write it down in a</span> <span m="3950583">way that I can verify it because otherwise I just am not smart</span> <span m="3955666">enough to carry through five equations in a row and expect</span> <span m="3960416">that everyone is going to be transformed appropriately.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3966000">OK, so you write it down. So I always write it down so I</span> <span m="3971529">can verify it. And that fortunately has the</span> <span m="3975754">side benefit that other people can understand what I've done as</span> <span m="3981988">well. OK, so what is this one?</span> </p>
<p><span m="3984904">This is two to the log of i minus one because the ceiling,</span> <span m="3990636">if this is an exact power of two, right, then ceiling of log</span> <span m="3996569">of i minus one is just log of i minus one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4002000">So, this is two to the log of i minus one, which is i minus one,</span> <span m="4012013">right? Yeah?</span> </p>
<p><span m="4013761">OK. OK, if it's an exact power of</span> <span m="4018846">two, then the log is an integer, right?</span> </p>
<p><span m="4026000">So, taking the ceiling, it doesn't matter,</span> <span m="4029713">get rid of the ceiling. OK, this one,</span> <span m="4032973">however, is not an exact power of two.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4036324">But what is it? It's just one more than this</span> <span m="4040218">guy. We know that i minus one is not</span> <span m="4043388">an exact power of two, so it's going to be the next</span> <span m="4047916">bigger one. OK, so that means this is what?</span> </p>
<p><span m="4056053">So, it's going to be, how do these two compare?</span> </p>
<p><span m="4065035">How much bigger is this one than this one?</span> </p>
<p><span m="4073041">It's twice the size. We know what this one is.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4083000">OK, or it can reason it from first principles.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4086656">This is going to be the log of i minus one plus one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4090800">OK, and so then you can reduce it to this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4094131">So, you've got to think about those floors and ceilings,</span> <span m="4098600">right? It's like, what's happening in</span> <span m="4101524">the round off there? OK, so now we can simplify</span> <span m="4105261">this. OK, so what do we have here?</span> </p>
<p><span m="4109000">We have, OK, so if I multiply this through,</span> <span m="4114136">I have an i plus two minus 2i plus two plus i minus one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4120863">I know a lot of you, probably 90% of you will do</span> <span m="4126611">this step. You will go directly from this</span> <span m="4131502">step to the last step. And that's where 30% of you,</span> <span m="4137618">or some number, will get it wrong.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4143000">OK, so let me encourage you to do that step.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4146818">OK, it's easier to find your bugs if you take it slow.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4151526">Actually, taking it slow is faster in the long run.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4155966">It's hard to teach young stallions, or phillies,</span> <span m="4160140">or whatever, OK?</span> </p>
<p><span m="4161473">Just take it easy. Just patience,</span> <span m="4164315">just do it slow, get it right.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4166890">It's actually faster. OK, everybody knows the</span> <span m="4172670">tortoise and hare story. Yeah, yeah, yeah,</span> <span m="4177432">OK, but nobody believes it. OK, so now here we have 2i</span> <span m="4183586">here, an i here, and an i here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4187069">And then, that leaves us with two plus two minus one,</span> <span m="4193109">equals three. Awesome, awesome.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4196593">OK, amortized cost is three when i minus one is an exact</span> <span m="4202980">power of two. OK, case two.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4230000">OK, i minus one is not an exact power of two.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4234829">So then we have c_i hat is equal to, now instead of i it's</span> <span m="4241085">one plus, and then the two minus two to the ceiling of log i plus</span> <span m="4248109">two to the ceiling of log of i minus one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4252500">OK, now what can somebody tell me about these two terms in the</span> <span m="4259195">case where i minus one is not an exact power of two?</span> </p>
<p><span m="4266000">What are they? Equal.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4269216">Why is that? Yeah, the ceiling is going to</span> <span m="4275809">do the same thing to both, going to take it up to the same</span> <span m="4284974">integer. So these two things are equal,</span> <span m="4291085">which means this is equal to three.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4298000">OK, so therefore, n inserts, OK,</span> <span m="4302405">so now I say, oh, the amortized cost is three</span> <span m="4308657">for every operation for every insert.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4313773">So therefore, n inserts costs,</span> <span m="4317894">well, the amortized cost of each is three.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4325000">So n of them, the amortized cost is 3n.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4328986">That's an upper bound on the worst-case true costs.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4334230">So, n inserts costs order n in the worst case.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4338951">OK, there is a bug in this analysis.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4342622">It's a minor bug. It's the one I pointed out</span> <span m="4347132">before the first insert has amortized cost of two,</span> <span m="4352272">and not three. I didn't actually deal with</span> <span m="4357182">that one carefully enough. OK, so that's an exercise to</span> <span m="4361547">just go and look to see where it is that that happens and how you</span> <span m="4366721">show that, in fact, the amortized cost of the first</span> <span m="4370763">one is two, OK, where that shows up.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4373592">OK, so to summarize, actually let me summarize over</span> <span m="4377634">here, conclusions about amortized analysis.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4397000">So amortized costs provide a clean abstraction for data</span> <span m="4415000">structure performance. So, what I can tell somebody,</span> <span m="4425556">so suppose I built a dynamic table, for example,</span> <span m="4429699">OK. It's easier to say,</span> <span m="4431638">in terms of your own performance modeling,</span> <span m="4435252">it costs a constant amount of time for each insert.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4439659">As long as you don't care about real-time behavior,</span> <span m="4444066">but only the aggregate behavior, that's a great</span> <span m="4448121">abstraction for the performance Rather than saying it's got</span> <span m="4454156">that complicated thing which sometimes cost you a lot,</span> <span m="4458390">how do they reason about that? But you could say every</span> <span m="4462624">operation costs me order one, that's really simple.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4466618">But they have to understand, it's order one in an amortized</span> <span m="4471251">sense, OK. So, if they do have a real-time</span> <span m="4474526">constraint to make, amortized doesn't cut it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4479000">OK, but for many problems, it's perfectly good.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4482159">It lets me explain it rather simply.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4484563">OK, we will see some other data structures that have amortized</span> <span m="4488752">costs where different operations have different amortized costs.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4493079">And the nice thing about that is I just add up,</span> <span m="4496239">what's the cost of all my different operations,</span> <span m="4499398">OK, where there is a different cost for each operation?</span> </p>
<p><span m="4504000">Some will be log n. Some will be order one,</span> <span m="4507068">or whatever. Add them up:</span> <span m="4508822">that's an upper bound on the true costs.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4511672">OK: tremendous simplification in abstracting and reasoning</span> <span m="4515837">about those complicated data structures.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4518686">OK, now, so this is probably, this is huge.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4521755">OK, abstraction, you know, computer science,</span> <span m="4524897">what teach you through four years of undergraduate,</span> <span m="4528551">and another year if you go on to M.Eng., and then if you get a</span> <span m="4533008">Ph.D., it's another 15 years or whatever it takes to get a Ph.D.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4539000">OK, all you teach about is abstraction: abstraction,</span> <span m="4544392">abstraction, abstraction.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4546929">So, this is a powerful abstraction: quite good.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4551792">Now, we learned three methods. In general, any method can be</span> <span m="4558030">used. You can convert one to the</span> <span m="4561308">other. But each has situations where</span> <span m="4570386">it is arguably simplest or most precise.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4580320">So, any of the methods can be used.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4590000">However, you must learn all of them, OK, because there are</span> <span m="4594299">going to be some situations where you need one,</span> <span m="4597768">where it's better to do one, better to do another.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4601464">If you're reading in the literature, you want to know</span> <span m="4605386">these different ways of doing it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4607800">And that means that even though you may get really comfortable</span> <span m="4612401">with accounting, OK, in an exam,</span> <span m="4614739">or whatever, I may say solve this with a</span> <span m="4617681">potential function argument. So, you want to be comfortable</span> <span m="4627441">with all the methods, OK.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4632595">Last point is that, in fact, different potential</span> <span m="4642687">functions or accounting costs may yield different bounds.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4656000">OK, so when you do an amortized analysis, there's nothing to say</span> <span m="4661628">that one set of costs is better than another.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4665559">So, just as an example, OK, in any data structure</span> <span m="4669847">generally that supports delete, I can amortize all the deletes</span> <span m="4675296">against the inserts. So, in general,</span> <span m="4678423">what I could do is say deletes are free, OK,</span> <span m="4682265">and charge twice as much for each insert.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4687000">OK, charging enough when I do the insert to amortize it</span> <span m="4690338">against the delete. That you could do with an</span> <span m="4693059">accounting method. You can also do it with a</span> <span m="4695717">potential method, the potential,</span> <span m="4697634">then, being the number of items that I actually have in my data</span> <span m="4701467">structure times the cost of the delete for each of those items.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4705300">OK, so the point is that I can allocate costs in different</span> <span m="4708825">ways. Or I could have amortized costs</span> <span m="4711919">which are equal to the true costs.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4713962">So, there are different ways that I could assign amortized</span> <span m="4717491">costs. There is no one way,</span> <span m="4719101">OK, and choosing different ones may yield different bounds.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4722692">It may not, but it may yield different bounds.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4725478">OK, generally it does yield different ones.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4728079">OK, next time: an amazing use of potential</span> <span m="4730617">functions. OK, the stuff is cool,</span> <span m="4732598">but let me tell you, Wednesday's lecture:</span> <span m="4735075">amazing. Amazing the type of analysis we</span> <span m="4737490">are going to be able to do.</span> </p>
