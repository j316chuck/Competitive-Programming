<p><span m="5000">The third step,</span> <span m="7000">So, there is a lot of Today we're going to not talk about sorting.</span> <span m="11000">This is an exciting new development. We know that what we're looking</span> <span m="14000">We're going to talk about another problem,</span> <span m="18000">a related problem, but a different problem.</span> <span m="35000">We're going to talk about another problem that we would</span> <span m="38000">like to solve in linear time. Last class we talked about we</span> <span m="41000">could do sorting in linear time. To do that we needed some</span> <span m="44000">additional assumptions. Today we're going to look at a</span> <span m="47000">problem that really only needs linear time, even though at</span> <span m="51000">first glance it might look like it requires sorting.</span> <span m="54000">So this is going to be an easier problem.</span> <span m="56000">The problem is I give you a bunch of numbers.</span> <span m="60000">Let's call them elements. And they are in some array,</span> <span m="66000">let's say. And they're in no particular</span> <span m="71000">order, so unsorted. I want to find the kth smallest</span> <span m="78000">element.</span> <span m="86000">This is called the element of rank k.</span> <span m="97000">In other words, I have this list of numbers</span> <span m="99000">which is unsorted. And, if I were to sort it,</span> <span m="103000">I would like to know what the kth element is.</span> <span m="106000">But I'm not allowed to sort it. One solution to this problem,</span> <span m="110000">this is the naÔve algorithm, is you just sort and then</span> <span m="114000">return the kth element. This is another possible</span> <span m="117000">definition of the problem. And we would like to do better</span> <span m="123000">than that. So you could sort,</span> <span m="125000">what's called the array A, and then return A[k].</span> <span m="130000">That is one thing we could do. And if we use heap sort or</span> <span m="136000">mergesort, this will take n lg n time.</span> <span m="140000">We would like to do better than n lg n.</span> <span m="143000">Ideally linear time. The problem is pretty natural,</span> <span m="149000">straightforward. It has various applications.</span> <span m="154000">Depending on how you choose k, k could be any number between 1</span> <span m="159000">and n. For example,</span> <span m="161000">if we choose k=1 that element has a name.</span> <span m="164000">Any suggestions of what the name is?</span> <span m="167000">The minimum. That's easy.</span> <span m="170000">Any suggestions on how we could find the minimum element in an</span> <span m="175000">array in linear time? Right.</span> <span m="179000">Just scan through the array. Keep track of what the smallest</span> <span m="184000">number is that you've seen. The same thing with the</span> <span m="188000">maximum, k=n. These are rather trivial.</span> <span m="192000">But a more interesting version of the order statistic problem</span> <span m="197000">is to find the median. This is either k equals n plus</span> <span m="201000">1 over 2 floor or ceiling. I will call both of those</span> <span m="206000">elements medians.</span> <span m="214000">Finding the median of an unsorted array in linear time is</span> <span m="217000">quite tricky. And that sort of is the main</span> <span m="219000">goal of this lecture, is to be able to find the</span> <span m="221000">medians. For free we're going to be able</span> <span m="223000">to find the arbitrary kth smallest element,</span> <span m="226000">but typically we're most interested in finding the</span> <span m="228000">median. And on Friday in recitation</span> <span m="230000">you'll see why that is so useful.</span> <span m="232000">There are all sorts of situations where you can use</span> <span m="235000">median for really effective divide-and-conquer without</span> <span m="238000">having to sort. You can solve a lot of problems</span> <span m="242000">in linear time as a result. And we're going to cover today</span> <span m="247000">two algorithms for finding order statistics.</span> <span m="250000">Both of them are linear time. The first one is randomized,</span> <span m="255000">so it's only linear expected time.</span> <span m="258000">And the second one is worst-case linear time,</span> <span m="261000">and it will build on the randomized version.</span> <span m="265000">Let's start with a randomize divide-and-conquer algorithm.</span> <span m="286000">This algorithm is called rand-select.</span> <span m="302000">And the parameters are a little bit more than what we're used</span> <span m="306000">to. The order statistics problem</span> <span m="308000">you're given an array A. And here I've changed notation</span> <span m="312000">and I'm looking for the ith smallest element,</span> <span m="315000">so i is the index I'm looking for.</span> <span m="318000">And I'm also going to change the problem a little bit.</span> <span m="321000">And instead of trying to find it in the whole array,</span> <span m="325000">I'm going to look in a particular interval of the</span> <span m="329000">array, A from p up to q. We're going to need that for a</span> <span m="333000">recursion. This better be a recursive</span> <span m="336000">algorithm because we're using divide-and-conquer.</span> <span m="339000">Here is the algorithm.</span> <span m="351000">With a base case. It's pretty simple.</span> <span m="354000">Then we're going to use part of the quicksort algorithm,</span> <span m="360000">randomized quicksort.</span> <span m="369000">We didn't actually define this subroutine two lectures ago,</span> <span m="373000">but you should know what it does, especially if you've read</span> <span m="377000">the textbook. This says in the array A[p...q]</span> <span m="380000">pick a random element, so pick a random index between</span> <span m="384000">p and q, swap it with the first element, then call partition.</span> <span m="390000">And partition uses that first element to split the rest of the</span> <span m="394000">array into less than or equal to that random partition and</span> <span m="399000">greater than or equal to that partition.</span> <span m="402000">This is just picking a random partition element between p and</span> <span m="407000">q, cutting the array in half, although the two sizes may not</span> <span m="412000">be equal. And it returns the index of</span> <span m="414000">that partition element, some number between p and q.</span> <span m="420000">And we're going to define k to be this particular value,</span> <span m="428000">r minus p plus 1. And the reason for that is that</span> <span m="435000">k is then the rank of the partition element.</span> <span m="441000">This is in A[p...q]. Let me draw a picture here.</span> <span m="450000">We have our array A. It starts at p and ends at q.</span> <span m="454000">There is other stuff, but for this recursive all we</span> <span m="458000">care about is p up to q. We pick a random partition</span> <span m="462000">element, say this one, and we partition things so that</span> <span m="467000">everything in here, let's call this r,</span> <span m="470000">is less than or equal to A[r] and everything up here is</span> <span m="475000">greater than or equal to A[r]. And A[r] is our partition</span> <span m="480000">element. After this call,</span> <span m="483000">that's what the array looks like.</span> <span m="486000">And we get r. We get the index of where</span> <span m="489000">partition element is stored. The number of elements that are</span> <span m="494000">less than or equal to A[r] and including r is r minus p plus 1.</span> <span m="500000">There will be r minus p elements here,</span> <span m="503000">and we're adding 1 to get this element.</span> <span m="508000">And, if you start counting at 1, if this is rank 1,</span> <span m="512000">rank 2, this element will have rank k.</span> <span m="515000">That's just from the construction in the partition.</span> <span m="520000">And now we get to recurse. And there are three cases --</span> <span m="533000">-- depending on how i relates to k.</span> <span m="535000">Remember i is the rank that we're looking for,</span> <span m="537000">k is the rank that we happen to get out of this random</span> <span m="541000">partition. We don't have much control over</span> <span m="543000">k, but if we're lucky i=k. That's the element we want.</span> <span m="553000">Then we just return the partition element.</span> <span m="555000">More likely is that the element we're looking for is either to</span> <span m="558000">the left or to the right. And if it's to the left we're</span> <span m="560000">going to recurse in the left-hand portion of the array.</span> <span m="563000">And if it's to the right we're going to recurse in the</span> <span m="566000">right-hand portion. So, pretty straightforward at</span> <span m="568000">this point.</span> <span m="585000">I just have to get all the indices right.</span> <span m="608000">Either we're going to recurse on the part between p and r</span> <span m="611000">minus 1, that's this case. The rank we're looking for is</span> <span m="614000">to the left of the rank of element A[r].</span> <span m="617000">Or, we're going to recurse on the right part between r plus 1</span> <span m="620000">and q. Where we recurse on the left</span> <span m="622000">part the rank we're looking for remains the same,</span> <span m="625000">but when we recurse on the right part the rank we're</span> <span m="628000">looking for gets offset. Because we sort of got rid of</span> <span m="633000">the k elements over here. I should have written this</span> <span m="638000">length is k. We've sort of swept away k</span> <span m="642000">ranks of elements. And now within this array we're</span> <span m="646000">looking for the i minus kth smallest element.</span> <span m="651000">That's the recursion. We only recurse once.</span> <span m="655000">And random partition is not a recursion.</span> <span m="660000">That just takes linear time. And the total amount of work</span> <span m="664000">we're doing here should be linear time plus one recursion.</span> <span m="669000">And we'd next like to see what the total running time is in</span> <span m="674000">expectation, but let's first do a little example --</span> <span m="686000">-- to make this algorithm perfectly clear.</span> <span m="689000">Let's suppose we're looking for the seventh smallest element in</span> <span m="693000">this array.</span> <span m="710000">And let's suppose, just for example,</span> <span m="713000">that the pivot we're using is just the first element.</span> <span m="717000">So, nothing fancy. I would have to flip a few</span> <span m="722000">coins in order to generate a random one, so let's just pick</span> <span m="726000">this one. If I partition at the element</span> <span m="729000">6, this is actually an example we did two weeks ago,</span> <span m="733000">and I won't go through it again, but we get the same</span> <span m="737000">array, as we did two weeks ago, namely 2, 5,</span> <span m="741000">3, 6, 8, 13, 10 and 11.</span> <span m="743000">If you run through the partitioning algorithm,</span> <span m="746000">that happens to be the order that it throws the elements</span> <span m="751000">into. And this is our position r.</span> <span m="755000">This is p here. It's just 1.</span> <span m="757000">And q is just the end. And I am looking for the</span> <span m="760000">seventh smallest element. And it happens when I run this</span> <span m="764000">partition that 6 falls into the fourth place.</span> <span m="768000">And we know that means, because all the elements here</span> <span m="772000">are less than 6 and all the elements here are greater than</span> <span m="776000">6, if this array were sorted, 6 would be right here in</span> <span m="780000">position four. So, r here is 4.</span> <span m="785000">Yeah? The 12 turned into an 11?</span> <span m="789000">This was an 11, believe it or not.</span> <span m="793000">Let me be simple. Sorry.</span> <span m="796000">Sometimes my ones look like twos.</span> <span m="800000">Not a good feature. That's an easy way to cover.</span> <span m="807000">[LAUGHTER] Don't try that on exams.</span> <span m="811000">Oh, that one was just a two. No.</span> <span m="813000">Even though we're not sorting the array, we're only spending</span> <span m="817000">linear work here to partition by</span> <span m="819000">We know that if we had sorted the array 6 would fall here.</span> <span m="823000">We don't know about these other elements.</span> <span m="826000">They're not in sorted order, but from the properties of</span> <span m="829000">partition we know 6 went the right spot.</span> <span m="832000">We now know rank of 6 is 4. We happened to be looking for 7</span> <span m="836000">and we happened to get this number 4.</span> <span m="840000">We want something over here. It turns out we're looking for</span> <span m="843000">10, I guess. No, 11.</span> <span m="845000">There should be eight elements in this array,</span> <span m="848000">so it's the next to max. Max here is 13,</span> <span m="850000">I'm cheating here. The answer we're looking for is</span> <span m="856000">for is in the right-hand part because the rank we're looking</span> <span m="860000">for is 7, which is bigger than</span> <span m="862000">Now, what rank are we looking for in here?</span> <span m="865000">Well, we've gotten rid of four elements over here.</span> <span m="870000">It happened here that k is also 4 because p is 1 in this</span> <span m="875000">example. The rank of 6 was 4.</span> <span m="878000">We throw away those four elements.</span> <span m="881000">Now we're looking for rank 7 minus 4 which is 3.</span> <span m="886000">And, indeed, the rank 3 element here is</span> <span m="889000">still 11. So, you recursively find that.</span> <span m="893000">That's your answer. Now that algorithm should be</span> <span m="898000">pretty clear. The tricky part is to analyze</span> <span m="903000">it. And the analysis here is quite</span> <span m="905000">a bit like randomized quicksort, although not quite as hairy,</span> <span m="910000">so it will go faster. But it will be also sort of a</span> <span m="913000">nice review of the randomized quicksort analysis which was a</span> <span m="918000">bit tricky and always good to see a couple of times.</span> <span m="921000">We're going to follow the same kind of outline as before to</span> <span m="926000">look at the expected running time of this algorithm.</span> <span m="931000">And to start out we're going to, as before,</span> <span m="934000">look at some intuition just to feel good about ourselves.</span> <span m="939000">Also feel bad as you'll see. Let's think about two sort of</span> <span m="944000">extreme cases, a good case and the worst case.</span> <span m="949000">And I should mention that in all of the analyses today we</span> <span m="954000">assume the elements are distinct.</span> <span m="964000">It gets really messy if the elements are not distinct.</span> <span m="968000">And you may even have to change the algorithms a little bit</span> <span m="972000">because if all the elements are equal, if you pick a random</span> <span m="976000">element, the partition does not do so well.</span> <span m="979000">But let's assume they're all distinct, which is the really</span> <span m="984000">interesting case. A pretty luck case --</span> <span m="988000">I mean the best cases we partition right in the middle.</span> <span m="992000">The number of elements to the left of our partition is equal</span> <span m="997000">to the number of elements to the right of our partition.</span> <span m="1002000">But almost as good would be some kind of 1/10 to 9/10 split.</span> <span m="1007000">Any constant fraction, we should feel that.</span> <span m="1010000">Any constant fraction is as good as 1/2.</span> <span m="1014000">Then the recurrence we get is, let's say at most,</span> <span m="1018000">this bad. So, it depends.</span> <span m="1021000">If we have let's say 1/10 on the left and 9/10 on the right</span> <span m="1024000">every time we do a partition. It depends where our answer is.</span> <span m="1028000">It could be if i is really small it's in the 1/10 part.</span> <span m="1032000">If i is really big it's going to be in the 9/10 part,</span> <span m="1036000">or most of the time it's going to be in the 9/10 part.</span> <span m="1039000">We're doing worst-case analysis within the lucky case,</span> <span m="1043000">so we're happy to have upper bounds.</span> <span m="1045000">I will say t(n) is at most t of T(9/10n)+Theta(n).</span> <span m="1050000">Clearly it's worse if we're in the bigger part.</span> <span m="1054000">What is the solution to this recurrence?</span> <span m="1058000">Oh, solving recurrence was so long ago.</span> <span m="1062000">What method should we use for solving this recurrence?</span> <span m="1067000">The master method. What case are we in?</span> <span m="1071000">Three. Good.</span> <span m="1072000">You still remember. This is Case 3.</span> <span m="1075000">We're looking at nlog_b(a). b here is 10/9,</span> <span m="1081000">although it doesn't really matter because a is 1.</span> <span m="1086000">log base anything of 1 is 0. So, this is n^0 which is 1.</span> <span m="1091000">And n is polynomially larger than 1.</span> <span m="1094000">This is going to be O(n), which is good.</span> <span m="1098000">That is what we want, linear time.</span> <span m="1101000">If we're in the lucky case, great.</span> <span m="1105000">Unfortunately this is only intuition.</span> <span m="1110000">And we're not always going to get the lucky case.</span> <span m="1112000">We could do the same kind of analysis as we did with</span> <span m="1115000">randomized quicksort. If you alternate between lucky</span> <span m="1118000">and unlucky, things will still be good, but let's just talk</span> <span m="1121000">about the unlucky case to show how bad things can get.</span> <span m="1124000">And this really would be a worst-case analysis.</span> <span m="1133000">The unlucky case we get a split of 0:n-1.</span> <span m="1140000">Because we're removing the partition element either way.</span> <span m="1144000">And there could be nothing less than the partition element.</span> <span m="1149000">We have 0 on the left-hand side and we have n-1 on the</span> <span m="1154000">right-hand side. Now we get a recurrence like</span> <span m="1158000">T(n)=T(n-1) plus linear cost. And what's the solution to that</span> <span m="1163000">recurrence? n^2.</span> <span m="1165000">Yes. This one you should just know.</span> <span m="1167000">It's n^2 because it's an arithmetic series.</span> <span m="1178000">And that's pretty bad. This is much,</span> <span m="1180000">much worse than sorting and then picking the ith element.</span> <span m="1183000">In the worst-case this algorithm really sucks,</span> <span m="1186000">but most of the time it's going to do really well.</span> <span m="1189000">And, unless you're really, really unlucky and every coin</span> <span m="1192000">you flip gives the wrong answer, you won't get this case and you</span> <span m="1196000">will get something more like the lucky case.</span> <span m="1198000">At least that's what we'd like to prove.</span> <span m="1202000">And we will prove that the expected running time here is</span> <span m="1205000">linear. So, it's very rare to get</span> <span m="1207000">anything quadratic. But later on we will see how to</span> <span m="1209000">make the worst-case linear as well.</span> <span m="1211000">This would really, really solve the problem.</span> <span m="1230000">Let's get into the analysis.</span> <span m="1243000">Now, you've seen an analysis much like this before.</span> <span m="1247000">What do you suggest we do in order to analyze this expected</span> <span m="1251000">time? It's a divide-and-conquer</span> <span m="1254000">algorithm, so we kind of like to write down the recurrence on</span> <span m="1259000">something resembling the running time.</span> <span m="1269000">I don't need the answer, but what's the first step that</span> <span m="1272000">we might do to analyze the expected running time of this</span> <span m="1276000">algorithm? Sorry?</span> <span m="1278000">Look at different cases, yeah.</span> <span m="1280000">Exactly. We have all these possible ways</span> <span m="1282000">that random partition could split.</span> <span m="1285000">It could split 0 to the n-1. It could split in half.</span> <span m="1290000">There are n choices where it could split.</span> <span m="1293000">How can we break into those cases?</span> <span m="1295000">Indicator random variables. Cool.</span> <span m="1298000">Exactly. That's what we want to do.</span> <span m="1301000">Indicator random variable suggests that what we're dealing</span> <span m="1306000">with is not exactly just a function T(n) but it's a random</span> <span m="1310000">variable. This is one subtlety.</span> <span m="1313000">T(n) depends on the random choices, so it's really a random</span> <span m="1317000">variable.</span> <span m="1325000">And then we're going to use indicator random variables to</span> <span m="1328000">get a recurrence on T(n).</span> <span m="1345000">So, T(n) is the running time of rand-select on an input of size</span> <span m="1352000">n.</span> <span m="1360000">And I am also going to write down explicitly an assumption</span> <span m="1366000">about the random numbers.</span> <span m="1375000">That they should be chosen independently from each other.</span> <span m="1380000">Every time I call random partition, it's generating a</span> <span m="1383000">completely independent random number from all the other times</span> <span m="1387000">I call random partition. That is important,</span> <span m="1390000">of course, for this analysis to work.</span> <span m="1392000">We will see why some point down the line.</span> <span m="1395000">And now, to sort of write down an equation for T(n) we're going</span> <span m="1399000">to define indicator random variables, as you suggested.</span> <span m="1416000">And we will call it X_k. And this is for all k=0...n-1.</span> <span m="1430000">Indicator random variables either 1 or 0.</span> <span m="1434000">And it's going to be 1 if the partition comes out k on the</span> <span m="1440000">left-hand side. So say the partition generates</span> <span m="1446000">a k:n-k-1 split and it is 0 otherwise.</span> <span m="1451000">We have n of these indicator random variables between</span> <span m="1457000">0...n-1. And in each case,</span> <span m="1460000">no matter how the random choice comes out, exactly one of them</span> <span m="1467000">will be 1. All the others will be 0.</span> <span m="1472000">Now we can divide out the running time of this algorithm</span> <span m="1477000">based on which case we're in.</span> <span m="1489000">That will sort of unify this intuition that we did and get</span> <span m="1497000">all the cases. And then we can look at the</span> <span m="1502000">expectation. T(n), if we just split out by</span> <span m="1508000">cases, we have an upper bound like this.</span> <span m="1528000">If we have 0 to n-1 split, the worst is we have n-1.</span> <span m="1533000">Then we have to recurse in a problem of size n-1.</span> <span m="1538000">In fact, it would be pretty hard to recurse in a problem of</span> <span m="1543000">size 0. If we have a 1 to n-2 split</span> <span m="1547000">then we take the max of the two sides.</span> <span m="1551000">That's certainly going to give us an upper bound and so on.</span> <span m="1563000">And at the bottom you get an n-1 to 0 split.</span> <span m="1574000">This is now sort of conditioning on various events,</span> <span m="1576000">but we have indicator random variables to tell us when these</span> <span m="1579000">events happen. We can just multiply each of</span> <span m="1581000">these values by the indicator random variable and it will come</span> <span m="1585000">out 0 if that's not the case and will come out 1 and give us this</span> <span m="1588000">value if that happens to be the split.</span> <span m="1591000">So, if we add up all of those we'll get the same thing.</span> <span m="1597000">This is equal to the sum over all k of the indicator random</span> <span m="1605000">variable times the cost in that case, which is t of max k,</span> <span m="1612000">and the other side, which is n-k-1,</span> <span m="1617000">plus theta n. This is our recurrence,</span> <span m="1621000">in some sense, for the random variable</span> <span m="1624000">representing running time. Now, the value will depend on</span> <span m="1629000">which case we come into. We know the probability of each</span> <span m="1633000">of these events happening is the same because we're choosing the</span> <span m="1639000">partition element uniformly at random, but we cannot really</span> <span m="1643000">simplify much beyond this until we take expectations.</span> <span m="1649000">We know this random variable could be as big as n^2.</span> <span m="1652000">Hopefully it's usually linear. We will take expectations of</span> <span m="1657000">both sides and get what we want.</span> <span m="1674000">Let's look at the expectation of this random variable,</span> <span m="1678000">which is just the expectation, I will copy over,</span> <span m="1682000">summation we have here so I can work on this board.</span> <span m="1710000">I want to compute the expectation of this summation.</span> <span m="1713000">What property of expectation should I use?</span> <span m="1716000">Linearity, good. We can bring the summation</span> <span m="1719000">outside.</span> <span m="1748000">Now I have a sum of expectation.</span> <span m="1749000">Let's look at each expectation individually.</span> <span m="1752000">It's a product of two random variables, if you will.</span> <span m="1755000">This is an indicator random variable and this is some more</span> <span m="1759000">complicated function, some more complicated random</span> <span m="1762000">variable representing some running time,</span> <span m="1764000">which depends on what random choices are made in that</span> <span m="1768000">recursive call. Now what should I do?</span> <span m="1771000">I have the expectation of the product of two random variables.</span> <span m="1777000">Independence, exactly.</span> <span m="1779000">If I know that these two random variables are independent then I</span> <span m="1785000">know that the expectation of the product is the product of the</span> <span m="1791000">expectations. Now we have to check are they</span> <span m="1795000">independent? I hope so because otherwise</span> <span m="1798000">there isn't much else I can do. Why are they independent?</span> <span m="1804000">Sorry? Because we stated that they</span> <span m="1807000">are, right. Because of this assumption.</span> <span m="1810000">We assume that all the random numbers are chosen</span> <span m="1814000">independently. We need to sort of interpolate</span> <span m="1817000">that here. These X_k's,</span> <span m="1819000">all the X_k's, X_0 up to X_n-1,</span> <span m="1821000">so all the ones appearing in this summation are dependent</span> <span m="1826000">upon a single random choice of this particular call to random</span> <span m="1830000">partition. All of these are correlated,</span> <span m="1836000">because if one of them is 1, all the others are forced to be</span> <span m="1847000">correlation among the X_k's. But with respect to everything</span> <span m="1854000">that is in here, and the only random part is</span> <span m="1860000">this T(max(kn-k-1)). That is the reason that this</span> <span m="1867000">random variable is independent from these.</span> <span m="1872000">The same thing as quicksort, but I know some people got</span> <span m="1879000">confused about it a couple lectures ago so I am</span> <span m="1884000">reiterating. We get the product of</span> <span m="1889000">expectations, E[X_k] E[T(max(kn-k-1))].</span> <span m="1895000">I mean the order n comes outside, but let's leave it</span> <span m="1900000">inside for now. There is no expectation to</span> <span m="1904000">compute there for order n. Order n is order n.</span> <span m="1909000">What is the expectation of X_k? 1/n, because they're all chosen</span> <span m="1915000">with equal probability. There is n of them,</span> <span m="1920000">so the expectation is 1/n. The value is either 1 or 0.</span> <span m="1924000">We start to be able to split this up.</span> <span m="1927000">We have 1/n times this expected value of some recursive T call,</span> <span m="1932000">and then we have plus 1 over n times order n,</span> <span m="1935000">also known as a constant, but everything is summed up n</span> <span m="1940000">times so let's expand this.</span> <span m="1955000">I have the sum k=0 to n-1. I guess the 1/n can come</span> <span m="1962000">outside. And we have expectation of</span> <span m="1967000">[T(max(kn-k-1))]. Lots of nifty braces there.</span> <span m="1974000">And then plus we have, on the other hand,</span> <span m="1979000">the sum k=0 to n-1. Let me just write that out</span> <span m="1986000">again. We have a 1/n in front and we</span> <span m="1988000">have a Theta(n) inside. This summation is n^2.</span> <span m="1992000">And then we're dividing by n, so this whole thing is,</span> <span m="1996000">again, order n. Nothing fancy happened there.</span> <span m="2000000">This is really just saying the expectation of order n is order</span> <span m="2005000">n. Average value of order n is</span> <span m="2007000">order n. What is interesting is this</span> <span m="2011000">part. Now, what could we do with this</span> <span m="2015000">summation? Here we start to differ from</span> <span m="2018000">randomized quicksort because we have this max.</span> <span m="2023000">Randomized quicksort we had the sum of T(k) plus T(n-k-1)</span> <span m="2028000">because we were making both recursive calls.</span> <span m="2032000">Here we're only making the biggest one.</span> <span m="2036000">That max is really a pain for evaluating this recurrence.</span> <span m="2043000">How could I get rid of the max? That's one way to think of it.</span> <span m="2051000">Yeah?</span> <span m="2058000">Exactly. I could only sum up to halfway</span> <span m="2060000">and then double. In other words,</span> <span m="2063000">terms are getting repeated twice here.</span> <span m="2066000">When k=0 or when k=n-1, I get the same T(n-1).</span> <span m="2070000">When k=1 or n-2, I get the same thing,</span> <span m="2073000">2 and n-3. What I will actually do is sum</span> <span m="2077000">from halfway up. That's a little bit cleaner.</span> <span m="2082000">And let me get the indices right.</span> <span m="2085000">Floor of n/2 up to n-1 will be safe.</span> <span m="2089000">And then I just have E[T(k)], except I forgot to multiply by</span> <span m="2095000">2, so I'm going to change this 1 to a 2.</span> <span m="2101000">And order n is preserved. This is just because each term</span> <span m="2104000">is appearing twice. I can factor it out.</span> <span m="2107000">And if n is odd, I'm actually double-counting</span> <span m="2110000">somewhat, but it's certain at most that.</span> <span m="2113000">So, that's a safe upper bound. And upper bounds are all we</span> <span m="2117000">care about because we're hoping to get linear.</span> <span m="2120000">And the running time of this algorithm is definitely at least</span> <span m="2124000">linear, so we just need an upper bounded linear.</span> <span m="2129000">So, this is a recurrence. E[T(n)] is at most 2/n times</span> <span m="2132000">the sum of half the numbers between 0 and n of</span> <span m="2136000">E[T(k)]+Theta(n). It's a bit of hairy recurrence.</span> <span m="2139000">We want to solve it, though.</span> <span m="2141000">And it's actually a little bit easier than the randomized</span> <span m="2145000">quicksort recurrence. We're going to solve it.</span> <span m="2148000">What method should we use? Sorry?</span> <span m="2151000">Master method? Master would be nice,</span> <span m="2153000">except that each of the recursive calls is with a</span> <span m="2157000">different value of k. The master method only works</span> <span m="2161000">when all the calls are with the same value, same size.</span> <span m="2165000">Alas, it would be nice if we could use the master method.</span> <span m="2169000">What else do we have? Substitution.</span> <span m="2171000">When it's hard, when in doubt,</span> <span m="2173000">use substitution. I mean the good thing here is</span> <span m="2176000">we know what we want. From the intuition at least,</span> <span m="2180000">which is now erased, we really feel that this should</span> <span m="2183000">be linear time. So, we know what we want to</span> <span m="2186000">prove. And indeed we can prove it just</span> <span m="2191000">directly with substitution.</span> <span m="2202000">I want to claim there is some constant c greater than zero</span> <span m="2206000">such that E[T(n)], according to this recurrence,</span> <span m="2209000">is at most c times n. Let's prove that over here.</span> <span m="2220000">As we guessed, the proof is by substitution.</span> <span m="2233000">What that means is we're going to assume, by induction,</span> <span m="2238000">that this inequality is true for all smaller m.</span> <span m="2242000">I will just say 4 less than n. And we need to prove it for n.</span> <span m="2248000">We get E[T(n)]. Now we are just going to expand</span> <span m="2253000">using the recurrence that we have.</span> <span m="2256000">It's at most this. I will copy that over.</span> <span m="2274000">And then each of these recursive calls is with some</span> <span m="2277000">value k that is strictly smaller than n.</span> <span m="2280000">Sorry, I copied it wrong, floor of n over 2,</span> <span m="2283000">not zero. And so I can apply the</span> <span m="2287000">induction hypothesis to each of these.</span> <span m="2291000">This is at most c times k by the induction hypothesis.</span> <span m="2296000">And so I get this inequality.</span> <span m="2317000">This c can come outside the summation because it's just a</span> <span m="2320000">constant. And I will be slightly tedious</span> <span m="2323000">in writing this down again, because what I care about is</span> <span m="2327000">the summation here that is left over.</span> <span m="2336000">This is a good old-fashioned summation.</span> <span m="2341000">And if you remember back to your summation tricks or</span> <span m="2344000">whatever, you should be able to evaluate this.</span> <span m="2347000">If we started at zero and went up to n minus 1,</span> <span m="2351000">that's just an arithmetic series, but here we have the</span> <span m="2354000">tail end of an arithmetic series.</span> <span m="2356000">And you should know, at least up to theta,</span> <span m="2359000">what this is, right?</span> <span m="2361000">n^2, yeah. It's definitely T(n^2).</span> <span m="2363000">But we need here a slightly better upper bond,</span> <span m="2366000">as we will see the constants really matter.</span> <span m="2371000">What we're going to use is that this summation is at most 3/8</span> <span m="2375000">times n^2. And that will be critical,</span> <span m="2378000">the fact that 3/8 is smaller than 1/2, I believe.</span> <span m="2381000">So it's going to get rid of this 2.</span> <span m="2384000">I am not going to prove this. This is an exercise.</span> <span m="2387000">When you know that it is true, it's easy because you can just</span> <span m="2392000">prove it by induction. Figuring out that number is a</span> <span m="2395000">little bit more work, but not too much more.</span> <span m="2400000">So you should prove that by induction.</span> <span m="2404000">Now let me simplify. This is a bit messy,</span> <span m="2409000">but what I want is c times n. Let's write it as our desired</span> <span m="2415000">value minus the residual. And here we have some crazy</span> <span m="2422000">fractions. This is 2 times 3 which is 6</span> <span m="2426000">over 8 which is 3/4, right?</span> <span m="2431000">Here we have 1, so we have to subtract up 1/4</span> <span m="2434000">to get 3/4. And this should be,</span> <span m="2437000">I guess, 1/4 times c times n. And then we have this theta n</span> <span m="2442000">with double negation becomes a plus theta n.</span> <span m="2445000">That should be clear. I am just rewriting that.</span> <span m="2449000">So we have what we want over here.</span> <span m="2452000">And then we hope that this is nonnegative because what we want</span> <span m="2457000">is that this less than or equal to c times n.</span> <span m="2463000">That will be true, provided this thing is</span> <span m="2466000">nonnegative. And it looks pretty good</span> <span m="2469000">because we're free to choose c however large we want.</span> <span m="2473000">Whatever constant is imbedded in this beta notation is one</span> <span m="2477000">fixed constant, whatever makes this recurrence</span> <span m="2481000">true. We just set c to be bigger than</span> <span m="2484000">4 times that constant and then this will be nonnegative.</span> <span m="2488000">So this is true for c sufficiently large to dwarf that</span> <span m="2492000">theta constant. It's also the base case.</span> <span m="2496000">I just have to make the cursory mention that we choose c large</span> <span m="2501000">enough so that this claim is true, even in the base case</span> <span m="2505000">where n is at most some constant.</span> <span m="2508000">Here it's like 1 or so because then we're not making a</span> <span m="2512000">recursive call. What we get --</span> <span m="2515000">This algorithm, randomize select,</span> <span m="2519000">has expected running time order n, Theta(n).</span> <span m="2532000">The annoying this is that in the worst-case,</span> <span m="2535000">if you're really, really unlucky it's n^2.</span> <span m="2539000">Any questions before we move on from this point?</span> <span m="2543000">This finished off the proof of this fact that we have Theta(n)</span> <span m="2549000">expected time. We already saw the n^2</span> <span m="2552000">worst-case. All perfectly clear?</span> <span m="2554000">Good. You should go over these</span> <span m="2557000">proofs. They're intrinsically related</span> <span m="2559000">between randomized quicksort and randomized select.</span> <span m="2563000">Know them in your heart. This is a great algorithm that</span> <span m="2567000">works really well in practice because most of the time you're</span> <span m="2572000">going to split, say, in the middle,</span> <span m="2574000">somewhere between a 1/4 and 3/4 and everything is good.</span> <span m="2580000">It's extremely unlikely that you get the n^2 worst-case.</span> <span m="2583000">It would have to happen with like 1 over n^n probability or</span> <span m="2586000">something really, really small.</span> <span m="2588000">But I am a theoretician at least.</span> <span m="2590000">And it would be really nice if you could get Theta(n) in the</span> <span m="2594000">worst-case. That would be the cleanest</span> <span m="2596000">result that you could hope for because that's optimal.</span> <span m="2599000">You cannot do better than Theta(n).</span> <span m="2601000">You've got to look at the elements.</span> <span m="2603000">So, you might ask, can we get rid of this</span> <span m="2605000">worst-case behavior and somehow avoid randomization and</span> <span m="2609000">guarantee Theta(n) worst-case running time?</span> <span m="2613000">And you can but it's a rather nontrivial algorithm.</span> <span m="2619000">And this is going to be one of the most sophisticated that</span> <span m="2625000">we've seen so far. It won't continue to be the</span> <span m="2631000">most sophisticated algorithm we will see, but here it is.</span> <span m="2638000">Worst-case linear time order statistics.</span> <span m="2649000">And this is an algorithm by several, all very famous people,</span> <span m="2662000">Blum, Floyd, Pratt, Rivest and Tarjan.</span> <span m="2672000">I think I've only met the B and the R and the T.</span> <span m="2675000">Oh, no, I've met Pratt as well. I'm getting close to all the</span> <span m="2679000">authors. This is a somewhat old result,</span> <span m="2682000">but at the time it was a major breakthrough and still is an</span> <span m="2686000">amazing algorithm. Ron Rivest is a professor here.</span> <span m="2690000">You should know him from the R in RSA.</span> <span m="2692000">When I took my PhD comprehensives some time ago,</span> <span m="2696000">on the cover sheet was a joke question.</span> <span m="2700000">It asked of the authors of the worst-case linear time order</span> <span m="2704000">statistics algorithm, which of them is the most rich?</span> <span m="2708000">Sadly it was not a graded part of the comprehensive exam,</span> <span m="2713000">but it was an amusing question. I won't answer it here because</span> <span m="2718000">we're on tape, [LAUGHTER] but think about it.</span> <span m="2721000">I may not be obvious. Several of them are rich.</span> <span m="2725000">It's just the question of who is the most rich.</span> <span m="2730000">Anyway, before they were rich they came up with this</span> <span m="2733000">algorithm. They've come up with many</span> <span m="2735000">algorithms since, even after getting rich,</span> <span m="2738000">believe it or not. What we want is a good pivot,</span> <span m="2742000">guaranteed good pivot. Random pivot is going to be</span> <span m="2745000">really good. And so the simplest algorithm</span> <span m="2748000">is just pick a random pivot. It's going to be good with high</span> <span m="2752000">probability. We want to force a good pivot</span> <span m="2755000">deterministically. And the new idea here is we're</span> <span m="2758000">going to generate it recursively.</span> <span m="2762000">What else could we do but recurse?</span> <span m="2764000">Well, you should know from your recurrences that if we did two</span> <span m="2768000">recursive calls on problems of half the size and we have a</span> <span m="2772000">linear extra work that's the mergesort recurrence,</span> <span m="2776000">T(n)=2[T(n/2)+Theta(n)]. You should recite in your</span> <span m="2780000">sleep. That's n lg n.</span> <span m="2781000">So we cannot recurse on two problems of half the size.</span> <span m="2785000">We've got to do better. Somehow these recursions have</span> <span m="2790000">to add up to strictly less than n.</span> <span m="2792000">That's the magic of this algorithm.</span> <span m="2795000">So this will just be called select instead of rand-select.</span> <span m="2799000">And it really depends on an array, but I will focus on the</span> <span m="2804000">i-th element that we want to select and the size of the array</span> <span m="2808000">that we want to select in. And I am going to write this</span> <span m="2813000">algorithm slightly less formally than randomize-select because</span> <span m="2817000">it's a bit higher level of an algorithm.</span> <span m="2842000">And let me draw over here the picture of the algorithm.</span> <span m="2851000">The first step is sort of the weirdest and it's one of the key</span> <span m="2856000">ideas. You take your elements,</span> <span m="2858000">and they are in no particular order, so instead of drawing</span> <span m="2863000">them on a line, I am going to draw them in a 5</span> <span m="2867000">by n over 5 grid. Why not?</span> <span m="2869000">This, unfortunately, take a little while to draw,</span> <span m="2874000">but it will take you equally long so I will take my time.</span> <span m="2880000">It doesn't really matter what the width is,</span> <span m="2882000">but it should be width n over 5 so make sure you draw your</span> <span m="2886000">figure accordingly. Width n over 5,</span> <span m="2888000">but the height should be exactly 5.</span> <span m="2890000">I think I got it right. I can count that high.</span> <span m="2893000">Here is 5. And this should be,</span> <span m="2895000">well, you know, our number may not be divisible</span> <span m="2897000">by 5, so maybe it ends off in sort of an odd way.</span> <span m="2900000">But what I would like is that these chunks should be floor of</span> <span m="2904000">n over 5. And then we will have,</span> <span m="2906000">at most, four elements left over.</span> <span m="2910000">So I am going to ignore those. They don't really matter.</span> <span m="2913000">It's just an additive constant. Here is my array.</span> <span m="2916000">I just happened to write it in this funny way.</span> <span m="2919000">And I will call these vertical things groups.</span> <span m="2922000">I would circle them, and I did that in my notes,</span> <span m="2925000">but things get really messy if you start circling.</span> <span m="2929000">This diagram is going to get really full, just to warn you.</span> <span m="2933000">By the end it will be almost unintelligible,</span> <span m="2935000">but there it is. If you are really feeling</span> <span m="2940000">bored, you can draw this a few times.</span> <span m="2943000">And you should draw how it grows.</span> <span m="2946000">So there are the groups, vertical groups of five.</span> <span m="2950000">Next step.</span> <span m="2958000">The second step is to recurse. This is where things are a bit</span> <span m="2964000">unusual, well, even more unusual.</span> <span m="2968000">Oops, sorry. I really should have had a line</span> <span m="2972000">between one and two so I am going to have to move this down</span> <span m="2977000">and insert it here. I also, in step one,</span> <span m="2980000">want to find the median of each group.</span> <span m="2993000">What I would like to do is just imagine this figure,</span> <span m="2996000">each of the five elements in each group gets reorganized so</span> <span m="2999000">that the middle one is the median.</span> <span m="3002000">So I am going to call these the medians of each group.</span> <span m="3005000">I have five elements so the median is right in the middle.</span> <span m="3010000">There are two elements less than the median,</span> <span m="3013000">two elements greater than the median.</span> <span m="3015000">Again, we're assuming all elements are distinct.</span> <span m="3019000">So there they are. I compute them.</span> <span m="3021000">How long does that take me? N over five groups,</span> <span m="3024000">each with five elements, compute the median of each one?</span> <span m="3030000">Sorry? Yeah, 2 times n over 5.</span> <span m="3032000">It's theta n, that's all I need to know.</span> <span m="3034000">I mean, you're counting comparisons, which is good.</span> <span m="3038000">It's definitely Theta(n). The point is within each group,</span> <span m="3042000">I only have to do a constant number of comparisons because</span> <span m="3046000">it's a constant number of elements.</span> <span m="3048000">It doesn't matter. You could use randomize select</span> <span m="3051000">for all I care. No matter what you do,</span> <span m="3054000">it can only take a constant number of comparisons.</span> <span m="3059000">As long as you don't make a comparison more than once.</span> <span m="3063000">So this is easy. You could sort the five numbers</span> <span m="3067000">and then look at the third one, it doesn't matter because there</span> <span m="3072000">are only five of them. That's one nifty idea.</span> <span m="3076000">Already we have some elements that are sort of vaguely in the</span> <span m="3081000">middle but just of the group. And we've only done linear</span> <span m="3085000">work. So doing well so far.</span> <span m="3089000">Now we get to the second step, which I started to write</span> <span m="3093000">before, where we recurse.</span> <span m="3118000">So the next idea is, well, we have these floor over</span> <span m="3121000">n over 5 medians. I am going to compute the</span> <span m="3124000">median of those medians. I am imagining that I</span> <span m="3127000">rearranged these. And, unfortunately,</span> <span m="3129000">it's an even number, there are six of them,</span> <span m="3131000">but I will rearrange so that this guy, I have drawn in a</span> <span m="3135000">second box, is the median of these elements so that these two</span> <span m="3138000">elements are strictly less than this guy, these three elements</span> <span m="3142000">are strictly greater than this guy.</span> <span m="3144000">Now, that doesn't directly tell me anything, it would seem,</span> <span m="3147000">about any of the elements out here.</span> <span m="3151000">We will come back to that. In fact, it does tell us about</span> <span m="3155000">some of the elements. But right now this element is</span> <span m="3158000">just the median of these guys. Each of these guys is a median</span> <span m="3162000">of five elements. That's all we know.</span> <span m="3165000">If we do that recursively, this is going to take T of n</span> <span m="3169000">over 5 time. So far so good.</span> <span m="3171000">We can afford a recursion on a problem of size n over 5 and</span> <span m="3175000">linear work. We know that works out to</span> <span m="3178000">linear time. But there is more.</span> <span m="3180000">We're obviously not done yet.</span> <span m="3190000">The next step is x is our partition element.</span> <span m="3192000">We partition there. The rest of the algorithm is</span> <span m="3195000">just like randomized partition, so we're going to define k to</span> <span m="3199000">be the rank of x. And this can be done,</span> <span m="3201000">I mean it's n minus r plus 1 or whatever, but I'm not going to</span> <span m="3205000">write out how to do that because we're at a higher level here.</span> <span m="3210000">But it can be done. And then we have the three-way</span> <span m="3214000">branching. So if i happens to equal k</span> <span m="3217000">we're happy. The pivot element is the</span> <span m="3221000">element we're looking for, but more likely i is either</span> <span m="3226000">less than k or it is bigger than k.</span> <span m="3229000">And then we make the appropriate recursive call,</span> <span m="3233000">so here we recursively select the i-th smallest element --</span> <span m="3248000">-- in the lower part of the array.</span> <span m="3251000">Left of the partition element. Otherwise, we recursively</span> <span m="3256000">select the i minus k-th smallest element in the upper part of the</span> <span m="3262000">array. I am writing this at a high</span> <span m="3265000">level because we've already seen it.</span> <span m="3270000">All of this is the same as the last couple steps of randomized</span> <span m="3276000">select.</span> <span m="3285000">That is the algorithm. The real question is why does</span> <span m="3288000">it work? Why is this linear time?</span> <span m="3290000">The first question is what's the recurrence?</span> <span m="3293000">We cannot quite write it down yet because we don't know how</span> <span m="3296000">big these recursive subproblems could be.</span> <span m="3300000">We're going to either recurse in the lower part or the upper</span> <span m="3303000">part, that's just like before. If we're unlucky and we have a</span> <span m="3307000">split of like zero to n minus one, this is going to be a</span> <span m="3311000">quadratic time algorithm. The claim is that this</span> <span m="3314000">partition element is guaranteed to be pretty good and good</span> <span m="3318000">enough. The running time of this thing</span> <span m="3321000">will be T of something times n, and we don't know what the</span> <span m="3324000">something is yet. How big could it be?</span> <span m="3327000">Well, I could ask you. But we're sort of indirect here</span> <span m="3332000">so I will tell you. We have already a recursive</span> <span m="3334000">call of T of n over 5. It better be that whatever</span> <span m="3338000">constant, so it's going to be something times n,</span> <span m="3341000">it better be that that constant is strictly less than 4/5.</span> <span m="3344000">If it's equal to 4/5 then you're not splitting up the</span> <span m="3348000">problem enough to get an n lg n running time.</span> <span m="3351000">If it's strictly less than 4/5 then you're reducing the problem</span> <span m="3355000">by at least a constant factor. In the sense if you add up all</span> <span m="3359000">the recursive subproblems, n over 5 and something times n,</span> <span m="3363000">you get something that is a constant strictly less than one</span> <span m="3367000">times n. That forces the work to be</span> <span m="3369000">geometric. If it's geometric you're going</span> <span m="3372000">to get linear time. So this is intuition but it's</span> <span m="3375000">the right intuition. Whenever you're aiming for</span> <span m="3378000">linear time keep that in mind. If you're doing a</span> <span m="3381000">divide-and-conquer, you've got to get the total</span> <span m="3384000">subproblem size to be some constant less than one times n.</span> <span m="3387000">That will work. OK, so we've got to work out</span> <span m="3392000">this constant here. And we're going to use this</span> <span m="3397000">figure, which so far looks surprisingly uncluttered.</span> <span m="3402000">Now we will make it cluttered. What I would like to do is draw</span> <span m="3408000">an arrow between two vertices, two points, elements,</span> <span m="3413000">whatever you want to call them. Let's call them a and b.</span> <span m="3420000">And I want to orient the arrow so it points to a larger value,</span> <span m="3424000">so this means that a is less than b.</span> <span m="3426000">This is notation just for the diagram.</span> <span m="3429000">And so this element, I am going to write down what I</span> <span m="3433000">know. This element is the median of</span> <span m="3435000">these five elements. I will suppose that it is drawn</span> <span m="3439000">so that these elements are larger than the median,</span> <span m="3442000">these elements are smaller than the median.</span> <span m="3445000">Therefore, I have arrows like this.</span> <span m="3448000">Here is where I wish I had some colored chalk.</span> <span m="3453000">This is just stating this guy is in the middle of those five</span> <span m="3456000">elements. I know that in every single</span> <span m="3459000">column.</span> <span m="3475000">Here is where the diagram starts to get messy.</span> <span m="3478000">I am not done yet. Now, we also know that this</span> <span m="3481000">element is the median of the medians.</span> <span m="3483000">Of all the squared elements, this guy is the middle.</span> <span m="3486000">And I will draw it so that these are the ones smaller than</span> <span m="3490000">the median, these are the ones larger than the median.</span> <span m="3493000">I mean the algorithm cannot do this.</span> <span m="3495000">It doesn't necessarily know how all this works.</span> <span m="3498000">I guess it could, but this is just for analysis</span> <span m="3500000">purposes. We know this guy is bigger than</span> <span m="3503000">that one and bigger than that one.</span> <span m="3505000">We don't directly know about the other elements.</span> <span m="3509000">We just know that that one is bigger than both of those and</span> <span m="3513000">this guy is smaller than these. Now, that is as messy as the</span> <span m="3517000">figure will get. Now, the nice thing about less</span> <span m="3520000">than is that it's a transitive relation.</span> <span m="3523000">If I have a directed path in this graph, I know that this</span> <span m="3527000">element is strictly less than that element because this is</span> <span m="3531000">less than that one and this is less than that one.</span> <span m="3534000">Even though directly I only know within a column and within</span> <span m="3539000">this middle row, I actually know that this</span> <span m="3542000">element -- This is x, by the way.</span> <span m="3545000">This element is larger than all of these elements because it's</span> <span m="3550000">larger than this one and this one and each of these is larger</span> <span m="3555000">than all of those by these arrows.</span> <span m="3557000">I also know that all of these elements in this rectangle here,</span> <span m="3562000">and you don't have to do this but I will make the background</span> <span m="3567000">even more cluttered. All of these elements in this</span> <span m="3572000">rectangle are greater than or equal to this one and all of the</span> <span m="3577000">elements in this rectangle are less than or equal to x.</span> <span m="3582000">Now, how many are there? Well, this is roughly halfway</span> <span m="3587000">along the set of groups and this is 3/5 of these columns.</span> <span m="3592000">So what we get is that there are at least --</span> <span m="3597000">We have n over 5 groups and we have half of the groups that</span> <span m="3603554">we're looking at here roughly, so let's call that floor of n</span> <span m="3610222">over 2, and then within each group we have three elements.</span> <span m="3616664">So we have at least 3 times floor of floor of n over 5 over</span> <span m="3623219">2 n floor elements that are less than or equal to x.</span> <span m="3630000">And we have the same that are greater than or equal to x.</span> <span m="3636222">Let me simplify this a little bit more.</span> <span m="3640444">I can also give you some more justification,</span> <span m="3645222">and we drew the picture, but just for why this is true.</span> <span m="3651222">We have at least n over 5 over 2 group medians that are less</span> <span m="3657777">than or equal to x. This is the argument we use.</span> <span m="3662622">We have half of the group medians are less than or equal</span> <span m="3665809">to x because x is the median of the group median,</span> <span m="3668590">so that is no big surprise. This is almost an equality but</span> <span m="3671892">we're making floors so it's greater than or equal to.</span> <span m="3674905">And then, for each group median, we know that there are</span> <span m="3678034">three elements there that are less than or equal to that group</span> <span m="3681568">median. So, by transitivity,</span> <span m="3683133">they're also less than or equal to x.</span> <span m="3685218">We get this number times three. This is actually just floor of</span> <span m="3690664">n over 10. I was being unnecessarily</span> <span m="3693773">complicated there, but that is where it came from.</span> <span m="3698126">What we know is that this thing is now at least 3 times n over</span> <span m="3703544">10, which is roughly 3/10 of elements are in one side.</span> <span m="3708252">In fact, at least 3/10 of the elements are in each side.</span> <span m="3713137">Therefore, each side has at most 7/10 elements roughly.</span> <span m="3719000">So the number here will be 7/10.</span> <span m="3721214">And, if I'm lucky, 7/10 plus 1/5 is strictly less</span> <span m="3724642">than one. I believe it is,</span> <span m="3726428">but I have trouble working with tenths.</span> <span m="3729142">I can only handle powers of two.</span> <span m="3731357">What we're going to use is a minor simplification,</span> <span m="3734857">which just barely still works, is a little bit easier to think</span> <span m="3739214">about. It's mainly to get rid of this</span> <span m="3741785">floor because the floor is annoying.</span> <span m="3744285">And we don't really have a sloppiness lemma that applies</span> <span m="3748214">here. It turns out if n is</span> <span m="3751463">sufficiently large, 3 times floor of n over 10 is</span> <span m="3754975">greater than or equal to 1/4. Quarters I can handle.</span> <span m="3758707">The claim is that each group has size at least 1/4,</span> <span m="3762365">therefore each group has size at most 3/4 because there's a</span> <span m="3766609">quarter on the side. This will be 3/4.</span> <span m="3769317">And I can definitely tell that 1/5 is less than 1/4.</span> <span m="3773048">This is going to add up to something strictly less than one</span> <span m="3777292">and then it will work. How is my time?</span> <span m="3781292">Good. At this point,</span> <span m="3782929">the rest of the analysis is easy.</span> <span m="3785686">How the heck you would come up with this algorithm,</span> <span m="3789993">you realize that this is clearly a really good choice for</span> <span m="3794818">finding a partition element, just barely good enough that</span> <span m="3799643">both recursions add up to linear time.</span> <span m="3802830">Well, that's why it took so many famous people.</span> <span m="3808000">Especially in quizzes, but I think in general this</span> <span m="3810780">class, you won't have to come up with an algorithm this clever</span> <span m="3814241">because you can just use this algorithm to find the median.</span> <span m="3817531">And the median is a really good partition element.</span> <span m="3820312">Now that you know this algorithm, now that we're beyond</span> <span m="3823375">1973, you don't need to know how to do this.</span> <span m="3825815">I mean you should know how this algorithm works,</span> <span m="3828482">but you don't need to do this in another algorithm because you</span> <span m="3831943">can just say run this algorithm, you will get the median in</span> <span m="3835234">linear time, and then you can partition to the left and the</span> <span m="3838524">right. And then the left and the right</span> <span m="3842225">will have exactly equal size. Great.</span> <span m="3844737">This is a really powerful subroutine.</span> <span m="3847321">You could use this all over the place, and you will on Friday.</span> <span m="3851700">Have I analyzed the running time pretty much?</span> <span m="3854858">The first step is linear. The second step is T of n over</span> <span m="3860027">I didn't write it, is linear.</span> <span m="3862037">And then the last step is just a recursive call.</span> <span m="3865410">And now we know that this is 3/4.</span> <span m="3874000">I get this recurrence. T of n is, I'll say at most,</span> <span m="3880000">T of n over 5 plus T of 3/4n. You could have also used 7/10.</span> <span m="3887079">It would give the same answer, but you would also need a floor</span> <span m="3894400">so we won't do that. I claim that this is linear.</span> <span m="3901000">How should I prove it? Substitution.</span> <span m="3912000">Claim that T of n is at most again c times n,</span> <span m="3915901">that will be enough. Proof is by substitution.</span> <span m="3919891">Again, we assume this is true for smaller n.</span> <span m="3923704">And want to prove it for n. We have T of n is at most this</span> <span m="3928758">thing. T of n over 5.</span> <span m="3931489">And by induction, because n of 5 is smaller than</span> <span m="3936489">n, we know that this is at most c.</span> <span m="3940000">Let me write it as c over 5 times n.</span> <span m="3943723">Sure, why not. Then we have here 3/4cn.</span> <span m="3947765">And then we have a linear term. Now, unfortunately,</span> <span m="3953085">I have to deal with things that are not powers of two.</span> <span m="3960000">I will cheat and look at my notes.</span> <span m="3962447">This is also known as 19/20 times c times n plus theta n.</span> <span m="3966599">And the point is just that this is strictly less than one.</span> <span m="3970826">Because it's strictly less than one, I can write this as one</span> <span m="3975202">times c of n minus some constant, here it happens to be</span> <span m="3979206">1/20, as long as I have something left over here,</span> <span m="3982766">1/20 times c times n. Then I have this annoying theta</span> <span m="3986622">n term which I want to get rid of because I want this to be</span> <span m="3990923">nonnegative. But it is nonnegative,</span> <span m="3994783">as long as I set c to be really, really large,</span> <span m="3998432">at least 20 times whatever constant is here.</span> <span m="4001918">So this is at most c times n for c sufficiently large.</span> <span m="4006216">And, oh, by the way, if n is less than or equal to</span> <span m="4010189">50, which we used up here, then T of n is a constant,</span> <span m="4014404">it doesn't really matter what you do, and T of n is at most c</span> <span m="4019270">times n for c sufficiently large.</span> <span m="4023000">That proves this claim. Of course, the constant here is</span> <span m="4026017">pretty damn big. It depends exactly what the</span> <span m="4028421">constants and the running times are, which depends on your</span> <span m="4031606">machine, but practically this algorithm is not so hot because</span> <span m="4034960">the constants are pretty big. Even though this element is</span> <span m="4038089">guaranteed to be somewhere vaguely in the middle,</span> <span m="4040772">and even though these recursions add up to strictly</span> <span m="4043566">less than n and it's geometric, it's geometric because the</span> <span m="4046752">problem is reducing by at least a factor of 19/20 each time.</span> <span m="4051000">So it actually takes a while for the problem to get really</span> <span m="4054742">small. Practically you probably don't</span> <span m="4057106">want to use this algorithm unless you cannot somehow flip</span> <span m="4060782">coins. The randomized algorithm works</span> <span m="4063146">really, really fast. Theoretically this is your</span> <span m="4066166">dream, the best you could hope for because it's linear time and</span> <span m="4070237">you need linear time as guaranteed linear time.</span> <span m="4073257">I will mention, before we end,</span> <span m="4075161">an exercise.</span> <span m="4083000">Why did we use groups of five? Why not groups of three?</span> <span m="4086375">As you might guess, the answer is because it</span> <span m="4089062">doesn't work with groups of three.</span> <span m="4091125">But it's quite constructive to find out why.</span> <span m="4093812">If you work through this math with groups of three instead of</span> <span m="4097562">groups of five, you will find that you don't</span> <span m="4100250">quite get the problem reduction that you need.</span> <span m="4103062">Five is the smallest number for which this works.</span> <span m="4107000">It would work with seven, but theoretically not any</span> <span m="4110176">better than a constant factor. Any questions?</span> <span m="4112973">All right. Then recitation Friday.</span> <span m="4115069">Homework lab Sunday. Problem set due Monday.</span> <span m="4117801">Quiz one in two weeks.</span> </p>
