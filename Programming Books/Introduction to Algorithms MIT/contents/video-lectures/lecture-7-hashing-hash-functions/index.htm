<p><span m="9000">Today starts a two-lecture sequence on the topic of</span> <span m="15000">hashing, which is a really great technique that shows up in a lot</span> <span m="23000">of places. So we're going to introduce it</span> <span m="28000">through a problem that comes up often in compilers called the</span> <span m="36000">symbol table problem. And the idea is that we have a</span> <span m="45000">table S holding n records where each record, just to be a little</span> <span m="57000">more explicit here. So each record typically has a</span> <span m="65000">bunch of, this is record x. x is usually a pointer to the</span> <span m="70000">actual data. So when we talk about the</span> <span m="74000">record x, what it usually means some pointer to the data.</span> </p>
<p><span m="80000">And in the data, in the record,</span> <span m="83000">so this is a record, there is a key called a key of</span> <span m="88000">x. In some languages it's key,</span> <span m="92000">it's x dot key or x arrow key, OK, are other ways that that</span> <span m="98000">will be denoted in some languages.</span> </p>
<p><span m="101000">And there's usually some additional data called satellite</span> <span m="106000">data, which is carried around with the key.</span> </p>
<p><span m="110000">This is also true in sorting, but usually you're sorting</span> <span m="116000">records. You're not sorting individual</span> <span m="119000">keys. And so the idea is that we have</span> <span m="123000">a bunch of operations that we would like to do on this data on</span> <span m="129000">this table. So we want to be able to insert</span> <span m="135000">an item x into the table, which just essentially means</span> <span m="140000">that we update the table by adding the element x.</span> </p>
<p><span m="145000">We want to be able to delete an item from the table --</span> <span m="158000">-- so removing the item x from the set and we want to be able</span> <span m="168000">to search for a given key. So this returns the value x</span> <span m="177000">such that key of x is equal to k, where it returns nil if</span> <span m="186000">there's no such x. So be able to insert items in,</span> <span m="193000">delete them and also look to see if there's an item that has</span> <span m="198000">a particular key. So notice that delete doesn't</span> <span m="202000">take a key. Delete takes a record.</span> </p>
<p><span m="205000">OK, so if you want to delete something of a particular key</span> <span m="210000">and you don't happen to have a pointer to it,</span> <span m="214000">you have to say let me search for it and then delete it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="220000">So these, whenever you have a set operations,</span> <span m="224000">where operations that change the set like in certain delete,</span> <span m="231000">we call it a dynamic set. So these two operations make</span> <span m="237000">the set dynamic. It changes over time.</span> </p>
<p><span m="241000">Sometimes you want to build a fixed data structure.</span> </p>
<p><span m="244000">It's going to be a static set. All you're going to do is do</span> <span m="248000">things like look it up and so forth.</span> </p>
<p><span m="251000">But most often, it turns out that in</span> <span m="253000">programming and so forth, we want to have the set be</span> <span m="257000">dynamic. Want to be able to add elements</span> <span m="259000">to it, delete elements to it and so forth.</span> </p>
<p><span m="262000">And there may be other operations that modify the set,</span> <span m="266000">modify membership in the set. So the simplest implementation</span> <span m="270000">for this is actually often overlooked.</span> </p>
<p><span m="274000">I'm actually surprised how often people use more</span> <span m="276000">complicated data structures when this simple data structure will</span> <span m="280000">work. It's called a direct access</span> <span m="282000">table. Doesn't always work.</span> </p>
<p><span m="284000">I'll give the conditions where it does.</span> </p>
<p><span m="293000">So it works when the keys are drawn from our small</span> <span m="298000">distribution. So suppose the keys are drawn</span> <span m="304000">from a set U of m elements. OK, zero to m minus one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="311000">And we're going to assume the keys are distinct.</span> </p>
<p><span m="328000">So the way a direct access table works is that you set up</span> <span m="332000">an array T --</span> <span m="341000">-- from zero to m minus one to represent the dynamic set S --</span> <span m="358000">-- such that T of k is going to be equal to x if x is in the set</span> <span m="370000">and its key is k and nil otherwise.</span> </p>
<p><span m="384000">So you just simply have an array and if you have a record</span> <span m="390000">whose key is some value k, the key is 15 say,</span> <span m="395000">then slot 15 if the element is there has the element.</span> </p>
<p><span m="402000">And if it's not in the set, it's nil.</span> </p>
<p><span m="404000">Very simple data structure. OK, insertion.</span> </p>
<p><span m="408000">Just go to that location and set the value to the inserted</span> <span m="412000">value. For deletion,</span> <span m="414000">just remove it from there. And to look it up,</span> <span m="417000">you just index it and see what's in that slot.</span> </p>
<p><span m="422000">OK, very simple data structure. All these operations,</span> <span m="429000">therefore, take constant time in the worst case.</span> </p>
<p><span m="435000">But as a practical matter, the places you can use this</span> <span m="443000">strategy are pretty limited. What's the issue of limitation</span> <span m="451000">here? Yes.</span> </p>
<p><span m="458000">OK, so that's a limitation surely.</span> </p>
<p><span m="461000">But there's actually a more severe limitation.</span> </p>
<p><span m="465000">Yeah. What does that mean,</span> <span m="468000">it's hard to draw?</span> </p>
<p></p>
<p><span m="485000">No. Yeah. m minus one could be a huge number.</span> </p>
<p><span m="489000">Like for example, suppose that I want to have my</span> <span m="494000">set drawn over 64 bit values. OK, the things that I'm storing</span> <span m="501000">in my table is a set of 64-bit numbers.</span> </p>
<p><span m="505000">And so, maybe a small set. Maybe we only have a few</span> <span m="510000">thousand of these elements. But they're drawn from a 64-bit</span> <span m="517000">value. Then this strategy requires me</span> <span m="521000">to have an array that goes from zero to 2 to the 64th minus one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="527000">How big is 2^64 minus one? Approximately?</span> </p>
<p><span m="531000">It's like big. It's like 18 quintillion or</span> <span m="535000">something. I mean, it's zillions literally</span> <span m="539000">because it's like it's beyond the illions we normally use.</span> </p>
<p><span m="546000">Not a billion or a trillion. It's 18 quintillion.</span> </p>
<p><span m="549000">OK, so that's a really big number.</span> </p>
<p><span m="552000">So, or even worse, suppose the keys were drawn</span> <span m="556000">from character strings, so people's names or something.</span> </p>
<p><span m="560000">This would be an awful way to have to represent it.</span> </p>
<p><span m="564000">Because most of the table would be empty for any reasonable set</span> <span m="569000">of values you would want to keep.</span> </p>
<p><span m="573000">So the idea is we want to try to keep something that's going</span> <span m="580000">to keep the table small, while still preserving some of</span> <span m="587000">the properties. And that's where hashing comes</span> <span m="593000">in. So hashing is we use a hash</span> <span m="596000">function H which maps the keys randomly.</span> </p>
<p><span m="603000">And I'm putting that in quotes because it's not quite at</span> <span m="608000">random. Into slots table T.</span> </p>
<p><span m="611000">So we call each of the array indexes here a slot.</span> </p>
<p><span m="616000">So you can just sort of think of it as a big table and you've</span> <span m="623000">got slots in the table where you're storing your values.</span> </p>
<p><span m="630000">And so, we may have a big universe of keys.</span> </p>
<p><span m="634000">Let's call that U. And we have our table over here</span> <span m="639000">that we've set up that has --</span> <span m="650000">-- m slots.</span> </p>
<p><span m="656000">And so we actually have then a set that we're actually going to</span> <span m="662000">try to represent S, which is presumably a very</span> <span m="667000">small piece of the universe. And what we'll do is we'll take</span> <span m="673000">an element from here and map it to let's say to there and take</span> <span m="678000">another one and we apply the hash function to the element.</span> </p>
<p><span m="683000">And what the hash function is going to give us is it's going</span> <span m="688000">to give us a particular slot. Here's one that might go up</span> <span m="694000">here. Might have another one over</span> <span m="697000">here that goes down to there. And so, we get it to distribute</span> <span m="704000">the elements over the table. So what's the problem that's</span> <span m="711000">going to occur as we do this? So far, I've been a little bit</span> <span m="718000">lucky. What's the problem potentially</span> <span m="721000">going to be?</span> </p>
<p><span m="729000">Yeah, when two things are in S, more specifically,</span> <span m="731000">get assigned to the same value. So I may have a guy here and he</span> <span m="735000">gets mapped to the same slot that somebody else has already</span> <span m="738000">been mapped to. And when this happens,</span> <span m="741000">we call that a collision.</span> </p>
<p><span m="749000">So we're trying to map these things down into a small set but</span> <span m="753000">we could get unlucky in our mapping, particularly if we map</span> <span m="758000">enough of these guys. They're not going to fit.</span> </p>
<p><span m="761000">So when a record --</span> <span m="774000">-- to be inserted maps to an already occupied slot --</span> <span m="799000">-- a collision occurs.</span> </p>
<p><span m="812000">OK. So looks like this method's no</span> <span m="814000">good. But no, there's a pretty simple</span> <span m="817000">thing we can do. What should we do when two</span> <span m="820000">things map to the same slot? If we want to represent the</span> <span m="824000">whole set, but you can't lose any data, can't treat it like a</span> <span m="829000">cache. In a cache what you do is it</span> <span m="832000">uses a hashing scheme, but in a cache,</span> <span m="834000">you just kick it out because you don't care about</span> <span m="838000">representing a set precisely. But in a hash table you're</span> <span m="844000">programming, you often want to make sure that the values you</span> <span m="848000">have are exactly the values in the sets so you can tell whether</span> <span m="854000">something belongs to the set or not.</span> </p>
<p><span m="856000">So what's a good strategy here? Yeah.</span> </p>
<p><span m="859000">Create a list for each slot and just put all the elements that</span> <span m="864000">hash to the same slot into the list.</span> </p>
<p><span m="867000">And that's called resolving collisions by chaining.</span> </p>
<p><span m="878000">And the idea is to link records in the same slot --</span> <span m="892000">-- into a list. So for example,</span> <span m="896000">imagine this is my hash table and this for example is slot i.</span> </p>
<p><span m="907000">I may have several things that are, so I'm going to put the key</span> <span m="913000">value --</span> <span m="922000">-- have several things that may have been inserted into this</span> <span m="928000">table that are elements of S. And what I'll do is just link</span> <span m="935000">them together. OK, so nil pointer here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="938000">And this is the satellite data and these are the keys.</span> </p>
<p><span m="943000">So if they're all linked together in slot i,</span> <span m="946000">then the hash function applied to 49 has got to be equal to the</span> <span m="951000">hash function of 86 is equal to the hash function of 52,</span> <span m="955000">which equals what?</span> </p>
<p><span m="968000">There's only one thing I haven't.</span> </p>
<p><span m="970000">i. Good.</span> </p>
<p><span m="971000">Even if you don't understand it, your quizmanship should tell</span> <span m="976000">you. He didn't mention i.</span> </p>
<p><span m="978000">That's equal to i. So the point is when I hash 49,</span> <span m="982000">the hash of 49 produces me some index in the table,</span> <span m="986000">say i, and everything that hashes to that same location is</span> <span m="991000">linked together into a list OK.</span> </p>
<p><span m="995000">Every record. Any questions about what the</span> <span m="999000">mechanics of this. I hope that most of you have</span> <span m="1004000">seen this, seen hashing, basic hashing in 6.001,</span> <span m="1009000">right? They teach it in?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1011000">They used to teach it 6.001. Yeah.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1015000">OK. Some people are saying maybe.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1018000">They used to teach it. Good.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1021000">So let's analyze this strategy. The analysis.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1027000">We'll first do worst case.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1038000">So what happens in the worst case?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1042000">With hashing? Yeah, raise your hand so that I</span> <span m="1047000">could call on you. Yeah.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1050000">Yeah, all hash keys, well all, all the keys in S.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1057000">I happen to pick a set S where my hash function happens to map</span> <span m="1066000">them all to the same value. That would be bad.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1074000">So every key hashes to the same slot.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1081000">And so, therefore if that happens, then what I've</span> <span m="1084000">essentially built is a fancy linked list for keeping this</span> <span m="1088000">data structure. All this stuff with the tables,</span> <span m="1091000">the hashing, etc., irrelevant.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1093000">All that matters is that I have a long linked list.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1097000">And then how long does an access take?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1100000">How long does it take me to insert something or well,</span> <span m="1103000">more importantly, to search for something.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1106000">Find out whether something's in there.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1109000">In the worst case. Yeah, it takes order n time.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1115000">Because they're all just a link, we just have a linked</span> <span m="1121000">list. So access takes data n time if</span> <span m="1126000">as we assume the size of S is equal to n.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1130000">So from a worst case point of view, this doesn't look so</span> <span m="1137000">attractive. And we will see data structures</span> <span m="1142000">that in worst case do very well for this problem.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1145000">But they don't do as good as the average case of hashing.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1149000">So let's analyze the average case.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1158000">In order to analyze the average case, I have to,</span> <span m="1161000">whenever you have averages, whenever you have probability,</span> <span m="1165000">you have to state your assumptions.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1167000">You have to say what is the assumption about the behavior of</span> <span m="1171000">the system. And it's very hard to do that</span> <span m="1174000">because you don't know necessarily what the hash</span> <span m="1176000">function is. Well, let's imagine an ideal</span> <span m="1179000">hash function. What should an ideal hash</span> <span m="1181000">function do?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1194000">Yeah, map the keys essentially at random to a slot.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1200000">Should really distribute them randomly.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1203000">So we call this the assumption --</span> <span m="1211000">-- of simple uniform hashing.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1224000">And what it means is that each key k in S is equally likely --</span> <span m="1241000">-- to be hashed to any slot in T and we're actually have to</span> <span m="1250000">make an independence assumption. Independent of where other</span> <span m="1260000">records, other keys are hashed.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1278000">So we're going to make this assumption and includes n an</span> <span m="1283000">independence assumption. That if I have two keys the</span> <span m="1287000">odds that they're hashed to the same place is therefore what?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1294000">What are the odds that two keys under this assumption are hashed</span> <span m="1299000">to the same slot, if I have, say,</span> <span m="1302000">m slots? One over m.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1304000">What are the odds that one key is hashed to slot 15?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1308000">One over m. Because they're being</span> <span m="1311000">distributed, but the odds in particular two keys are hashed</span> <span m="1316000">to the same slot, one over m.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1328000">So let's define. Is there a question?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1334000">No. OK.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1336000">The load factor of a hash table with n keys at m slots to be</span> <span m="1347000">alpha which is equal to n over m, which is also if you think</span> <span m="1358000">about it, just the average number of keys per slot.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1378000">So alpha is the average number of keys per, we call it the load</span> <span m="1382000">factor of the table. OK.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1384000">How many on average keys do I have?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1387000">So the expected, we'll look first at</span> <span m="1391000">unsuccessful search time. So by unsuccessful search,</span> <span m="1397000">I mean I'm looking for something that's actually not in</span> <span m="1402000">the table. It's going to return nil.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1406000">I look for a key that's not in the table.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1412000">It's going to be what? It's going to be order.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1415000">Well, I have to do a certain amount of work just to calculate</span> <span m="1420000">the hash function and so forth. It's going to be order at least</span> <span m="1426000">one plus, then I have to search the list and on average how much</span> <span m="1431000">of the list do I have to search?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1441000">What's the cost of searching that list?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1444000">On average. If I'm searching at random.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1448000">If I'm searching for a key that's not in the table.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1453000">Whichever one it is, I got to search to the end of</span> <span m="1458000">the list, right? So what's the average cost over</span> <span m="1463000">all the slots in the table? Alpha.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1466000">Right? Alpha.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1467000">That's the average length of a list.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1473000">So this is essentially the cost of doing the hash and then</span> <span m="1480000">accessing the slot and that is just the cost of searching the</span> <span m="1487000">list.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1494000">So the expected unsuccessful search time is proportional</span> <span m="1498000">essentially to alpha and if alpha's bigger than one,</span> <span m="1502000">it's order alpha. If alpha's less than one,</span> <span m="1505000">it's constant.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1513000">So when is the expected search time --</span> <span m="1526000">-- equal to order one?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1534000">So when is this order one?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1546000">Simple questions, by the way.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1548000">I only ask simple questions. Some guys ask hard questions.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1553000">Yeah. Or in terms first we'll get</span> <span m="1555000">there in two steps, OK.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1557000">In terms of alpha, it's when?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1561000">When alpha is constant. If alpha in particular is.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1566000">Alpha doesn't have to be constant.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1570000">It could be less than constant. It's O of one,</span> <span m="1575000">right. OK, or equivalently,</span> <span m="1578000">which is what you said, if n is O of m.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1582000">OK, which is to say if the number of elements in the table</span> <span m="1589000">is order, is upper bounded by a constant times n.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1596000">Then the search cost is constant.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1598000">So a lot of people will tell you oh, a hash table runs in</span> <span m="1602000">constant search time. OK, that's actually wrong.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1605000">It depends upon the load factor of the hash table.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1608000">And people have made programming errors based on that</span> <span m="1612000">misunderstanding of hash tables. Because they have a hash table</span> <span m="1616000">that's too small for the number of elements they're putting in</span> <span m="1620000">there. Doesn't help.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1623000">The number may in fact will grow with the,</span> <span m="1627000">since this is one plus n over m, it actually grows with n.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1634000">So unless you make sure that m keeps up with n,</span> <span m="1638000">this doesn't stay constant. Now it turns out for a</span> <span m="1644000">successful search, it's also one plus alpha.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1650000">And for that you need to do a little bit more mathematics</span> <span m="1654000">because you now have to condition on searching for the</span> <span m="1658000">items in the table. But it turns out it's also one</span> <span m="1661000">plus alpha and that you can read about in the book.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1665000">And also, there's a more rigorous proof of this.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1669000">I sort of have glossed over the expectation stuff here,</span> <span m="1673000">doing sort of a more intuitive proof.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1675000">So both of those things you should look for in the book.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1681000">So this is one reason why hashing is such a popular</span> <span m="1685000">method, is it basically lets you represent a dynamic set with</span> <span m="1690000">order one cost per operation, constant cost per operation,</span> <span m="1694000">inserting, deleting and so forth, as long as the table that</span> <span m="1699000">you're keeping is not much smaller than the number of items</span> <span m="1704000">that you're putting in there. And then all the operations end</span> <span m="1709000">up being constant time. But it depends upon,</span> <span m="1713000">strongly upon this assumption of simple uniform hashing.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1717000">And so no matter what hash function you pick,</span> <span m="1721000">I can always find a set of elements that are going to hash,</span> <span m="1725000">that that hash function is going to hash badly.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1729000">I just could generate a whole bunch of them and look to see</span> <span m="1733000">where the hash function takes them and in the end pick a whole</span> <span m="1738000">bunch that hash to the same place.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1742000">We're actually going to see a way of countering that,</span> <span m="1745000">but in practice people understand that most programs</span> <span m="1749000">that need to use things aren't really reverse engineering the</span> <span m="1754000">hash function. And so, there's some very</span> <span m="1757000">simple hash functions that seem to work fairly well in practice.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1761000">So in choosing a hash function --</span> <span m="1772000">-- we would like it to distribute</span> <span m="1780000">-- keys uniformly into slots and we also would like that</span> <span m="1791000">regularity in the key distributions --</span> <span m="1806000">-- should not affect uniformity.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1808000">For example, a regularity that you often see</span> <span m="1812000">is that all the keys that are being inserted are even numbers.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1817000">Somebody happens to have that property of his data,</span> <span m="1821000">that they're only inserting even numbers.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1824000">In fact, on many machines, since they use byte pointers,</span> <span m="1829000">if they're sorting things that are for example,</span> <span m="1833000">indexes to arrays or something like that, in fact,</span> <span m="1837000">they're numbers that are typically divisible by four.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1843000">Or by eight. So you don't want regularity in</span> <span m="1845000">the key distribution to affect the fact that you're</span> <span m="1849000">distributing slots. So probably the most popular</span> <span m="1852000">method that's used just for a quick hash function is what's</span> <span m="1856000">called the division method.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1867000">And the idea here is that you simply let h of k for a key</span> <span m="1871000">equal k modulo m, where m is the number of slots</span> <span m="1875000">in your table.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1884000">And this works reasonably well in practice, but you want to be</span> <span m="1888000">careful about your choice of modulus.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1891000">In other words, it turns out it doesn't work</span> <span m="1893000">well for every possible size of table you might want to pick.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1896000">Fortunately when you're building hash tables,</span> <span m="1898000">you don't usually care about the specific size of the table.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1902000">If you pick it around some size, that's probably fine</span> <span m="1905000">because it's not going to affect their performance.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1907000">So there's no need to pick a specific value.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1910000">In particular, you don't want to pick --</span> <span m="1920000">-- m with a small divisor --</span> <span m="1931000">-- and let me illustrate why that's a bad idea for this</span> <span m="1934000">particular hash function.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1947000">I should have said small divisor d.</span> </p>
<p><span m="1955000">So for example --</span> <span m="1960000">-- if D is two, in other words m is an even</span> <span m="1965000">number, and it turns out that we have the situation I just</span> <span m="1972000">mentioned, all keys are even, what happens to my usage of the</span> <span m="1980000">hash table? So I have an even slot,</span> <span m="1984000">even number of slots, and all the keys that the user</span> <span m="1989000">of the hash table chooses to pick happen to be even numbers,</span> <span m="1994000">what's going to happen in terms of my use of the hash table?</span> </p>
<p><span m="1999000">Well, in the worst case, they are always all going to</span> <span m="2004000">point in the same slot no matter what hash function I pick.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2010000">But here, let's say that, in fact, my hash function does</span> <span m="2015000">do a pretty good job of distributing,</span> <span m="2019000">but I have this property. What's a property that's going</span> <span m="2025000">to have no matter what set of keys I pick that satisfies this</span> <span m="2031000">property? What's going to happen to the</span> <span m="2035000">hash table? So, I have even number,</span> <span m="2038000">mod an even number. What does that say about the</span> <span m="2044000">hash function? It's even, right?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2048000">I have an even number mod. It's even.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2051000">So, what's going to happen to my use of the table?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2056000">Yeah, you're never going to hash anything to an odd-numbered</span> <span m="2062000">slot. You wasted half your slots.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2066000">It doesn't matter what the key distribution is.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2072000">OK, as long as they're all even, OK, that means the odds</span> <span m="2078000">slots are never used. OK, an extreme example,</span> <span m="2083000">here's another example, imagine that m is equal to two</span> <span m="2089000">to the r. In other words,</span> <span m="2092000">all its factors are small divisors, OK?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2098000">In that case, if I think about taking k mod</span> <span m="2106000">n, OK, the hash doesn't even depend on all the bits of k,</span> <span m="2118000">OK? So, for example,</span> <span m="2122000">suppose I had one..., and r equals six,</span> <span m="2131000">OK, so m is two to the sixth. So, I take this binary number,</span> <span m="2143000">mod two to the sixth, what's the hash value?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2150000">If I take something mod a power of two, what does it do?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2159000">So, I hash this function. This is k, OK,</span> <span m="2166000">in binary. And I take it mod two to the</span> <span m="2172000">sixth. Well, if I took it mod two,</span> <span m="2177000">what's the answer? What's this number mod two?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2184000">Zero, right. OK, what's this number mod</span> <span m="2189000">four? One zero.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2192000">What is it mod two to the sixth?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2195000">Yeah, it's just these last six bits.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2199000">This is H of k. OK, when you take something mod</span> <span m="2203000">a power of two, all you're doing is taking its</span> <span m="2208000">low order bits. OK, mod two to the r,</span> <span m="2211000">you are taking its r low order bits.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2214000">So, the hash function doesn't even depend on what's up here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2222000">So, that's a pretty bad situation because generally you</span> <span m="2225000">would like a very common regularity that you'll see in</span> <span m="2229000">data is that all the low order bits are the same,</span> <span m="2232000">and all the high order bits differ, or vice versa.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2236000">So, this particular is not a very good one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2240000">So, good heuristics for this is to pick m to be a prime,</span> <span m="2245000">not too close to a power of two or ten because those are the two</span> <span m="2251000">common bases that you see regularity in the world.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2256000">A prime is sometimes inconvenient,</span> <span m="2259000">however. But generally,</span> <span m="2261000">it's fairly easy to find primes.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2264000">And there's a lot of nice theorems about primes.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2269000">So, generally what you do, if you're just coding up</span> <span m="2274000">something and you know what it is, you can pick a prime out of</span> <span m="2280000">a textbook or look it up on the web or write a little program,</span> <span m="2286000">or whatever, and pick a prime.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2291000">Not too close to a power of two or ten, and it will probably</span> <span m="2295000">work pretty well. It will probably work pretty</span> <span m="2298000">well. So, this is a very popular</span> <span m="2300000">method, the division method. OK, but the next method we are</span> <span m="2304000">going to see is actually usually superior.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2307000">The reason people do this is because they can write in-line</span> <span m="2312000">in their code. OK, but it's not usually the</span> <span m="2316000">best method. And the reason is because</span> <span m="2319000">division, one of the reasons is division tends to take a lot of</span> <span m="2324000">cycles to compute on most computers compared with</span> <span m="2328000">multiplication or addition. OK, in fact,</span> <span m="2331000">it's usually done with taking several multiplications.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2335000">So, the next method is actually generally better,</span> <span m="2339000">but none of the hash function methods that we are talking</span> <span m="2343000">about today are, in some sense,</span> <span m="2346000">provably good hash functions. OK, so for the multiplication</span> <span m="2352000">method, the nice thing about it is just essentially requires</span> <span m="2358000">multiplication to do. And, for that is,</span> <span m="2362000">also, we are going to assume that the number of slots is a</span> <span m="2368000">power of two which is also often very convenient.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2372000">OK, and for this, we're going to assume that the</span> <span m="2377000">computer has w bit words. So, it would be convenient on a</span> <span m="2384000">computer with 32 bits, or 64 bits, for example.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2390000">OK, this would be very convenient.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2394000">So, the hash function is the following.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2399000">h of k is equal to A times k mod, two to the w,</span> <span m="2404000">right shifted by w minus r. OK, so the key part of this is</span> <span m="2412000">A, which has chosen to be an odd integer in the range between two</span> <span m="2420000">to the w minus one and two to the w.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2424000">OK, so it's an odd integer that the full width of the computer</span> <span m="2431000">word. OK, and what you do is multiply</span> <span m="2436000">it by whatever your key is, by this funny integer.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2442000">And, then take it mod two to the w.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2447000">And then, you take the result and right shift it by this fixed</span> <span m="2454000">amount, w minus r. So, this is a bit wise right</span> <span m="2460000">shift. OK, so let's look at what this</span> <span m="2466000">does. But first, let me just give you</span> <span m="2472000">a couple of tips on how you pick, or what you don't pick for</span> <span m="2481000">A. So, you don't pick A too close</span> <span m="2487000">to a power of two. And, it's generally a pretty</span> <span m="2494000">fast method because multiplication mod two to the w</span> <span m="2502000">is faster than division. And the other thing is that a</span> <span m="2509000">right shift is fast, especially because this is a</span> <span m="2512000">known shift. OK, you know it before you are</span> <span m="2515000">computing the hash function. Both w and r are known in</span> <span m="2519000">advance. So, the compiler can often do</span> <span m="2522000">tricks there to make it go even faster.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2526000">So, let's do an example to understand how this hash</span> <span m="2531000">function works. So, we will have,</span> <span m="2534000">in this case, a number of slots will be</span> <span m="2538000">eight, which is two to the three.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2542000">And, we'll have a bizarre word size of seven bits.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2546000">Anybody know any seven bit computers out there?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2553000">OK, well, here's one. So, A is our fixed value that's</span> <span m="2559000">used for hashing all our keys. And, in this case,</span> <span m="2565000">let's say it's 1011001. So, that's A.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2570000">And, I take in some value for k that I'm going to multiply.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2577000">So, k is going to be 1101011. So, that's my k.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2584000">And, I multiply them. What I multiply two,</span> <span m="2587000">each of these is the full word width.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2590000">You can view it as the full word width of the machine,</span> <span m="2594000">in this case, seven bits.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2596000">So, in general, this would be like a 32 bit</span> <span m="2600000">number, and my key, I'd be multiplying two 32 bit</span> <span m="2604000">numbers, for example. OK, and so, when I multiply</span> <span m="2608000">that out, I get a 2w bit answer. So, when you multiply two w bit</span> <span m="2613000">numbers, you get a 2w bit answer.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2618000">In this case, it happens to be that number,</span> <span m="2624000">OK? So, that's the product part,</span> <span m="2629000">OK? And then we take it mod two to</span> <span m="2634000">the w. Well, what mod two to the w</span> <span m="2639000">says is that I'm just taking, ignoring the high order bits of</span> <span m="2649000">this product. So, all of these are ignored,</span> <span m="2656000">because, remember that if I take something,</span> <span m="2662000">mod, a power of two, that's just the low order bits.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2670000">So, I just get these low order bits as being the mod.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2673000">And then, the right shift operation, and that's good also,</span> <span m="2678000">by the way, because a lot of machines, when I multiply two 32</span> <span m="2682000">bit numbers, they'll have an instruction that gives you just</span> <span m="2686000">the 32 lower bits. And, it's usually an</span> <span m="2689000">instruction that's faster than the instruction that gives you</span> <span m="2694000">the full 64 bit answer. OK, so, that's very convenient.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2698000">And, the second thing is, then, that I want just the,</span> <span m="2701000">in this case, three bits that are the high</span> <span m="2704000">order bits of this word. So, this ends up being my H of</span> <span m="2711000">k. And these end up getting</span> <span m="2713000">removed by right shifting this word over.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2718000">So, you just right shift that in, zeros come in,</span> <span m="2723000">in a high order bit, and you end up getting that</span> <span m="2728000">value of H of k. OK, so to understand what's</span> <span m="2732000">going on here, why this is a pretty good</span> <span m="2736000">method, or what's happening with it, you can imagine that one way</span> <span m="2743000">to think about it is to think of A as being a binary fraction.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2752000">So, imagine that the decimal point is here,</span> <span m="2755000">sorry, the binary point, OK, the radix point is here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2760000">Then when I multiply things, I'm just taking,</span> <span m="2763000">the binary point ends up being there.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2766000">OK, so if you just imagine that conceptually,</span> <span m="2769000">we don't have to actually put this into the hardware because</span> <span m="2774000">we just do what the hardware does.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2776000">But, I can imagine that it's there, and that it's here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2780000">And so, what I'm really taking is the fractional part of this</span> <span m="2785000">product if I treat A as a fraction of a number.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2789000">So, we can certainly look at that as sort of a modular wheel.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2795000">So, here I have a wheel where this is going to be,</span> <span m="2799000">that I'm going to divide into eight parts, OK,</span> <span m="2803000">where this point is zero. And then, I go around,</span> <span m="2808000">and this point is then one. And, I go around,</span> <span m="2812000">and this point is two, and so forth,</span> <span m="2815000">so that all the integers, if I wrap it around this unit</span> <span m="2821000">wheel, all the integers lined up at the zero point here,</span> <span m="2826000">OK? And then, we can divide this</span> <span m="2830000">into the fractional pieces. So, that's essentially the zero</span> <span m="2834000">point. This is the one eighth,</span> <span m="2837000">because we are dividing into eight, two, three,</span> <span m="2840000">four, five, six, seven.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2843000">So, if I have one times A, in this case,</span> <span m="2848000">I'm basically saying, well, one times A,</span> <span m="2853000">if I multiply, is basically going around to</span> <span m="2859000">about there, five and a half I think, right,</span> <span m="2865000">because one times A is about five and a half,</span> <span m="2871000">OK, or five halves of 5.5 eighths, essentially.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2879000">So, it takes me about to there. That's A.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2884000">And, if I do 2^A, that continues around,</span> <span m="2889000">and takes me up to about, where?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2892000">About, a little past three, about to there.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2898000">So, that's 2^A. OK, and 3^A takes me,</span> <span m="2902000">then, around to somewhere like about there.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2908000">So, each time I add another A, it's taking me another A's</span> <span m="2915000">distance around. And, the idea is that if A is,</span> <span m="2921000">for example, odd, and it's not too close to</span> <span m="2924000">a power of two, then what's happening is sort</span> <span m="2928000">of throwing it into another slot on a different thing.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2932000">So, if I now go around, if I have k being very big,</span> <span m="2937000">then k times A is going around k times.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2941000">Where does it end up? It's like spinning a wheel of</span> <span m="2944000">fortune or something. OK, it ends somewhere.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2946000">OK, and so that's basically the notion.</span> </p>
<p><span m="2949000">That's basically the notion, that it's going to end up in</span> <span m="2952000">some place. So, you're basically looking</span> <span m="2955000">at, where does ka end up? Well, it sort of whirls around,</span> <span m="2958000">and ends up at some point. OK, and so that's why that</span> <span m="2962000">tends to be a fairly good one. But, these are only heuristic</span> <span m="2966000">methods for hashing, because for any hash function,</span> <span m="2969000">you can always find a set of keys that's going to make it</span> <span m="2972000">operate badly. So, the question is,</span> <span m="2978000">well, what do you use in practice?</span> </p>
<p><span m="2984000">OK, the second topic that I want to tie it,</span> <span m="2992000">so, we talked about resolving collisions by chaining.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3003000">OK, there's another way of resolving collisions,</span> <span m="3011000">which is often useful, which is resolving collisions</span> <span m="3019000">by what's called open addressing.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3025000">OK, and the idea is, in this method,</span> <span m="3031000">is we have no storage for links.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3038000">So, when I result by chaining, I'd need an extra linked field</span> <span m="3043000">in each record in order to be able to do that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3047000">Now, that's not necessarily a big overhead,</span> <span m="3051000">but for some applications, I don't want to have to touch</span> <span m="3057000">those records at all. OK, and for those,</span> <span m="3060000">open addressing is a useful way to resolve collisions.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3067000">So, the idea is, with open addressing,</span> <span m="3070000">is if I hash to a given slot, and the slot is full,</span> <span m="3075000">OK, what I do is I just hash again with a different hash</span> <span m="3081000">function, with my second hash function.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3085000">I check that slot. OK, if that slot is full,</span> <span m="3089000">OK, then I hash again. And, I keep this probe</span> <span m="3094000">sequence, which hopefully is a permutation so that I'm not</span> <span m="3099000">going back and checking things that I've already checked until</span> <span m="3103000">I find a place to put it. And, if I got a good probe</span> <span m="3107000">sequence that I will hopefully, then, find a place to put it</span> <span m="3112000">fairly quickly. OK, and then to search,</span> <span m="3115000">I just follow the same probe sequence.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3119000">So, the idea, here, is we probe the table</span> <span m="3125000">systematically until an empty slot is found,</span> <span m="3132000">OK? And so, we can extend that by</span> <span m="3137000">looking as if the sequence of hash functions were,</span> <span m="3145000">in fact, a hash function that took two arguments:</span> <span m="3152000">a key and a probe step. In other words,</span> <span m="3160000">is it the zero of one our first one?</span> </p>
<p><span m="3164000">It's the second one, etc.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3168000">So, it takes two arguments. So, H is then going to map our</span> <span m="3175000">universe of keys cross, our probe number into a slot.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3184000">So, this is the universe of keys.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3190000">This is the probe number. And, this is going to be the</span> <span m="3200000">slot. Now, as I mentioned,</span> <span m="3205000">the probe sequence should be permutation.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3214000">In other words, it should just be the numbers</span> <span m="3218000">from zero to n minus one in some fairly random order.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3224000">OK, it should just be rearranged.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3228000">And the other thing about open addressing is that you don't</span> <span m="3234000">have to worry about n chaining is that the table may actually</span> <span m="3241000">fill up. So, you have to have that the</span> <span m="3245000">number of elements in the table is less than or equal to the</span> <span m="3250000">table size, the number of slots because the table may fill up.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3256000">And, if it's full, you're going to probe</span> <span m="3259000">everywhere. You are never going to get a</span> <span m="3263000">place to put it. And, the final thing is that in</span> <span m="3267000">this type of scheme, deletion is difficult.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3272000">It's not impossible. There are schemes for doing</span> <span m="3274000">deletion. But, it's basically hard</span> <span m="3276000">because the danger is that you remove a key out of the table,</span> <span m="3280000">and now, somebody who's doing a probe sequence who would have</span> <span m="3284000">hit that key and gone to find his element now finds that it's</span> <span m="3287000">an empty slot. And he says,</span> <span m="3289000">oh, the key I am looking for probably isn't there.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3292000">OK, so you have that issue to deal with.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3294000">So, you can delete things but keep them marked,</span> <span m="3297000">and there's all kinds of schemes that people have for</span> <span m="3300000">doing deletion. But it's difficult.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3304000">It's messy compared to chaining, where you can just</span> <span m="3307000">remove the element out of the chain.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3309000">So, let's do an example --</span> <span m="3325000">-- just so that we make sure we're on the same page.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3337000">So, we'll insert a key. k is 496.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3345000">OK, so here's my table. And, I've got some values in</span> <span m="3357000">it, 586, 133, 204, 481, etc.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3366000">So, the table looks like that; the other places are empty.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3373000">So, on my zero step, I probe H of 496,</span> <span m="3378000">zero. OK, and let's say that takes me</span> <span m="3382000">to the slot where there's 204. And so, I say,</span> <span m="3388000">oh, there's something there. I have to probe again.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3396000">So then, I probe H of 496, one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3401000">Maybe that maps me there, and I discover,</span> <span m="3407000">oh, there's something there. So, now, I probe H of 496,</span> <span m="3415000">two. Maybe that takes me to there.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3422000">It's empty. So, if I'm doing a search,</span> <span m="3424000">I report nil. If I'm doing in the insert,</span> <span m="3427000">I put it there. And then, if I'm looking for</span> <span m="3431000">that value, if I put it there, then when I'm looking,</span> <span m="3435000">I go through exactly the same sequence.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3438000">I'll find these things are busy, and then,</span> <span m="3441000">eventually, I'll come up and discover the value.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3446000">OK, and there are various heuristics that people use,</span> <span m="3449000">as well, like keeping track of the longest probe sequence</span> <span m="3454000">because there's no point in probing beyond the largest</span> <span m="3457000">number of probes that need to be done globally to do an</span> <span m="3461000">insertion. OK, so if it took me 5,</span> <span m="3464000">5 is the maximum number of probes I ever did for an</span> <span m="3468000">insertion. A search never has to look more</span> <span m="3471000">than five, OK, and so sometimes hash tables</span> <span m="3474000">will keep that auxiliary value so that it can quit rather than</span> <span m="3478000">continuing to probe until it doesn't find something.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3484000">OK, so, search is the same probe sequence.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3493000">And, if it's successful, it finds the record.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3503000">And, if it's unsuccessful, you find a nil.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3514000">OK, so it's pretty straightforward.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3517000">So, once again, as with just hash functions to</span> <span m="3522000">begin with, there are a lot of ideas about how you should form</span> <span m="3529000">a probe sequence, ways of doing this effectively.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3546000">OK, so the simplest one is called linear probing,</span> <span m="3554000">and what you do there is you have H of k comma i.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3562000">You just make that be some H prime of k, zero plus i mod m.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3573000">Sorry, no prime there. OK, so what happens is,</span> <span m="3576000">so, the idea here is that all you are doing on the I'th probe</span> <span m="3581000">is, on the zero'th probe, you look at H of k zero.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3584000">On probe one, you just look at the slot after</span> <span m="3588000">that. Probe two, you look at the slot</span> <span m="3590000">after that. So, you're just simply,</span> <span m="3593000">rather than sort of jumping around like this,</span> <span m="3596000">you probe there and then just find the next one that will fit</span> <span m="3601542">in. OK, so you just scan down mod</span> <span m="3604785">m. So, if you hit the bottom,</span> <span m="3606509">you go to the top. OK, so the I'th one,</span> <span m="3608848">so that's fairly easy to do because you don't have to</span> <span m="3612050">recomputed a full hash function each time.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3614574">All you have to do is add one each time you go because the</span> <span m="3618083">difference between this and the previous one is just one.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3621531">OK, so you just go down. Now, the problem with that is</span> <span m="3624794">that you get a phenomenon of clustering.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3627195">If you get a few things in a given area, then suddenly</span> <span m="3630458">everything, everybody has to keep searching to the end of</span> <span m="3633906">those things. OK, so that turns out not to be</span> <span m="3638277">one of the better schemes, although it's not bad if you</span> <span m="3642246">just need to do something quick and dirty.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3645258">So, it suffers from primary clustering, where regions of the</span> <span m="3649594">hash table get very full. And then, anything that hashes</span> <span m="3653635">into that region has to look through all the stuff that's</span> <span m="3657750">there. OK, so: long runs of filled</span> <span m="3662030">slots. OK, there's also things like</span> <span m="3665846">quadratic clustering, where you basically make this</span> <span m="3671459">be, instead of adding one each time, you add i each time.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3677744">OK, but probably the most effective popular scheme is</span> <span m="3683581">what's called double hashing. And, you can do statistical</span> <span m="3689867">studies. People have done statistical</span> <span m="3695715">studies to show that this is a good scheme, OK,</span> <span m="3701819">where you let H of k, i, let me do it below here</span> <span m="3708056">because I have for them. So, H of k, i is equal to an</span> <span m="3714957">H_1 of k plus i times H_2 of k. So, you have two hash functions</span> <span m="3723467">on m. You have two hash functions,</span> <span m="3727157">H_1 of k and H_2 of k. OK, so you compute the two hash</span> <span m="3733085">functions, and what you do is you start by just using H_1 of k</span> <span m="3739907">for the zero probe, because here,</span> <span m="3743486">i, then, will be zero. OK.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3746282">Then, for the probe number one, OK, you just add H_2 of k.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3754000">For probe number two, you just add that hash function</span> <span m="3757466">amount again. You just keep adding H_2 of k</span> <span m="3760266">for each successive probe you make.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3762533">So, it's fairly easy; you compute two hash functions</span> <span m="3765933">up front, OK, or you can delay the second</span> <span m="3768599">one, in case. But basically,</span> <span m="3770400">you compute two up front, and then you just keep adding</span> <span m="3774000">the second one in. You start at the location of</span> <span m="3777066">the first one, and keep adding the second one,</span> <span m="3780066">mod m, to determine your probe sequences.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3784000">So, this is an excellent method.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3787757">OK, it does a fine job, and you usually pick m to be a</span> <span m="3794181">power of two here, OK, so that you're using,</span> <span m="3799393">usually people use this with the multiplication method,</span> <span m="3805939">for example, so that m is a power of two,</span> <span m="3810787">and H_2 of k you force to be odd.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3816000">OK, so we don't use and even value there, because otherwise</span> <span m="3820578">for any particular key, you'd be skipping over.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3824210">Once again, you would have the problem that everything could be</span> <span m="3829105">even, or everything could be odd as you're going through.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3833526">But, if you make H_2 of k odd, and m is a power of two,</span> <span m="3837788">you are guaranteed to hit every slot.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3840631">OK, so let's analyze this scheme.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3843157">This turns out to be a pretty interesting scheme to analyze.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3849000">It's got some nice math in it. So, once again,</span> <span m="3854080">in the worst case, hashing is lousy.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3858032">So, we're going to analyze average case.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3875000">OK, and for this, we need a little bit stronger</span> <span m="3885615">assumption than for chaining. And, we call it the assumption</span> <span m="3899230">of uniform hashing, which says that each key is</span> <span m="3909846">equally likely, OK, to have any one of the m</span> <span m="3919769">factorial permutations as its probe sequence,</span> <span m="3932000">independent of other keys.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3945000">And, the theorem we're going to prove is that the expected</span> <span m="3955291">number of probes is, at most, one over one minus</span> <span m="3963777">alpha if alpha is less than one, OK,</span> <span m="3971000">that is, if the number of keys in the table is less than number</span> <span m="3977000">of slots. OK, so we're going to show that</span> <span m="3980870">the number of probes is one over one minus alpha.</span> </p>
<p><span m="3994000">So, alpha is the load factor, and of course,</span> <span m="3998700">for open addressing, we want the load factor to be</span> <span m="4004057">less than one because if we have more keys than slots,</span> <span m="4009852">open addressing simply doesn't work, OK, because you've got to</span> <span m="4016520">find a place for every key in the table.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4020784">So, the proof, we'll look at an unsuccessful</span> <span m="4025485">search, OK? So, the first thing is that one</span> <span m="4032908">probe is always necessary. OK, so if I have n over m,</span> <span m="4041141">sorry, if I have n items stored in m slots, what's the</span> <span m="4049533">probability that when I do that probe I get a collision with</span> <span m="4058875">something that's already in the table?</span> </p>
<p><span m="4066000">What's the probability that I get a collision?</span> </p>
<p><span m="4071526">Yeah? Yeah, n over m,</span> <span m="4073982">right? So, with probability,</span> <span m="4077298">n over m, we have a collision because my table has got n</span> <span m="4084052">things in there. I'm hashing,</span> <span m="4088487">at random, to one of them. OK, so, what are the odds I hit</span> <span m="4095551">something, n over m? And then, a second probe is</span> <span m="4101376">necessary. OK, so then,</span> <span m="4104102">I do a second probe. And, with what probability on</span> <span m="4110175">the second probe do I get a collision?</span> </p>
<p><span m="4116000">So, we're going to make the assumption of uniform hashing.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4120158">Each key is equally likely to have any one of the m factorial</span> <span m="4124536">permutations as its probe sequence.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4127017">So, what is the probability that on the second probe,</span> <span m="4130810">OK, I get a collision?</span> </p>
<p><span m="4150000">Yeah? If it's a permutation,</span> <span m="4154778">you're not, right? Something like that.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4161504">What is it exactly? So, that's the question.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4170000">OK, so you are not going to hit the same slot because it's going</span> <span m="4175478">to be a permutation. Yeah?</span> </p>
<p><span m="4177652">That's exactly right. n minus one over m minus one</span> <span m="4181913">because I'm now, I've essentially eliminated</span> <span m="4185652">that slot that I hit the first time.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4188694">And so, I have, now, and there was a key there.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4192694">So, now I'm essentially looking, at random,</span> <span m="4196347">into the remaining n minus one slots where there are</span> <span m="4200782">aggregately n minus one keys in those slots.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4206000">OK, everybody got that? OK, so with that probability,</span> <span m="4211306">I get a collision. That means that I need a third</span> <span m="4216204">probe necessary, OK?</span> </p>
<p><span m="4218142">And, we keep going on. OK, so what is it going to be</span> <span m="4223346">the next time? Yeah, it's going to be n minus</span> <span m="4227836">two over m minus two. So, let's note,</span> <span m="4233939">OK, that n minus i over m minus i is less than n over m,</span> <span m="4244716">which equals alpha, OK?</span> </p>
<p><span m="4249027">So, n minus i over m minus i is less than n over m.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4260000">And, the way you can sort of reason that is that if n is less</span> <span m="4265505">than m, I'm subtracting a larger fraction of n when I subtract i</span> <span m="4271287">than I am subtracting a fraction of m.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4274682">OK, so therefore, n minus i over m minus i is</span> <span m="4278720">going to be less than n over m. OK, so, or you can do the</span> <span m="4283858">algebra. I think it's always helpful</span> <span m="4287070">when you do algebra to sort of think about it sort of</span> <span m="4291842">quantitatively as well, you know, qualitatively what's</span> <span m="4296705">going on. So, the expected number of</span> <span m="4302119">probes is, then, going to be equal to,</span> <span m="4306559">it's going to be equal to because we're going to need some</span> <span m="4313399">space, well, we have one which is forced because we've got to</span> <span m="4320600">do one probe, plus with probability n over m,</span> <span m="4329308">I have to do another probe plus with probability of n over m</span> <span m="4341313">minus one I have to do another probe up until I do one plus one</span> <span m="4353930">over m minus n. OK, so each one is cascading</span> <span m="4360276">what's happened. In the book,</span> <span m="4362553">there is a more rigorous proof of this using indicator random</span> <span m="4367432">variables. I'm going to give you the short</span> <span m="4370767">version. OK, so basically,</span> <span m="4372800">this is my first probe. With probability n over m,</span> <span m="4376784">I had to do a second one. And, the result of that is that</span> <span m="4381338">with probability n minus one over m minus one,</span> <span m="4384997">I have to do another. And, with probability n over</span> <span m="4388982">two minus m over two, I have to do another,</span> <span m="4392397">and so forth. So, that's how many probes I'm</span> <span m="4398857">going to end up doing. So, this is less than or equal</span> <span m="4405542">to one plus alpha. There's one plus alpha times</span> <span m="4411457">one plus alpha times one plus alpha, OK, just using the fact</span> <span m="4419042">that I had here. OK, and that is less than or</span> <span m="4425536">equal to one plus I just multiply through here.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4431347">Alpha plus alpha squared plus alpha cubed plus k.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4437410">I can just take that out to infinity.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4441957">It's going to bound this. OK, does everybody see the math</span> <span m="4450206">there? OK, and that is just the sum,</span> <span m="4454954">I, equals zero to infinity, alpha to the I,</span> <span m="4460653">which is equal to one over one minus alpha using your familiar</span> <span m="4468929">geometric series bound. OK, and there's also,</span> <span m="4474615">in the textbook, an analysis of the successful</span> <span m="4478076">search, which, once again, is a little bit</span> <span m="4481230">more technical because you have to worry about what the</span> <span m="4485384">distribution is that you happen to have in the table when you</span> <span m="4490000">are searching for something that's already in the table.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4494230">But, it turns out it's also bounded by one over one minus</span> <span m="4498538">alpha. So, let's just look to see what</span> <span m="4504920">that means. So, if alpha is less than one</span> <span m="4511269">is a constant, it implies that it takes order</span> <span m="4518253">one probes. OK, so if alpha is a constant,</span> <span m="4524761">it takes order one probes. OK, but it's helpful to</span> <span m="4533621">understand what's happening with the constant.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4540706">So, for example, if the table is 50% full,</span> <span m="4547161">so alpha is a half, what's the expected number of</span> <span m="4554719">probes by this analysis? Two, because one over one minus</span> <span m="4563378">a half is two. If I let the table fill up to</span> <span m="4571531">90%, how many probes do I need on average?</span> </p>
<p><span m="4577937">Ten. So, you can see that as you</span> <span m="4582781">fill up the table, the cost is going dramatically,</span> <span m="4590437">OK? And so, typically,</span> <span m="4593955">you don't let the table get too full.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4597865">OK, you don't want to be pushing 99.9% utilization.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4603297">Oh, I got this great hash table that's got full utilization.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4609706">It's like, yeah, and it's slow.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4612964">It's really, really slow,</span> <span m="4615571">OK, because as alpha approaches one, the time is approaching and</span> <span m="4622415">essentially m, or n.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4626000">Good. So, next time,</span> <span m="4628050">we are going to address head-on in what was one of the most,</span> <span m="4634419">I think, interesting ideas in algorithms.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4638737">We are going to talk about how you solve this problem that no</span> <span m="4645213">matter what hash function you pick, there's a bad set of keys.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4651798">OK, so next time we're going to show that there are ways of</span> <span m="4658058">confronting that problem, very clever ways.</span> </p>
<p><span m="4662592">And we use a lot of math for it so will be a really fun lecture.</span> </p>
