<p><span m="1000">Good.</span> <span m="3000">Log base 2 of 7 is going be a</span> <span m="14000"> Good morning everyone. Today we are going to do some</span> <span m="18000">algorithms, back to algorithms, and we are going to use a lot</span> <span m="23000">of the, well, some of the simpler mathematics</span> <span m="27000">that we developed last class like the master theorem for</span> <span m="31000">solving recurrences. We are going to use this a lot.</span> <span m="35000">Because we are going to talk about recursive algorithms</span> <span m="39000">today. And so we will find their</span> <span m="41000">running time using the master theorem.</span> <span m="43000">This is just the same as it was last time, I hope,</span> <span m="46000">unless I made a mistake. A couple of reminders.</span> <span m="49000">You should all go to recitation on Friday.</span> <span m="52000">That is required. If you want to,</span> <span m="54000">you can go to homework lab on Sunday.</span> <span m="56000">That may be a good excuse for you to actually work on your</span> <span m="59000">problem set a few hours early. Well, actually,</span> <span m="64000">it's due on Wednesday so you have lots of time.</span> <span m="67000">And there is no class on Monday.</span> <span m="70000">It is the holiday known as Student Holiday,</span> <span m="73000">so don't come. Today we are going to cover</span> <span m="76000">something called Divide and Conquer.</span> <span m="87000">Also known as divide and rule or divide et impera for those of</span> <span m="91000">you who know Latin, which is a tried and tested way</span> <span m="94000">of conquering a land by dividing it into sections of some kind.</span> <span m="99000">It could be different political factions, different whatever.</span> <span m="103000">And then somehow making them no longer like each other.</span> <span m="107000">Like starting a family feud is always a good method.</span> <span m="110000">You should remember this on your quiz.</span> <span m="113000">I'm kidding. And if you can separate this</span> <span m="116000">big power structure into little power structures such that you</span> <span m="120000">dominate each little power structure then you can conquer</span> <span m="123000">all of them individually, as long as you make sure they</span> <span m="126000">don't get back together. That is divide and conquer as</span> <span m="129000">practiced, say, by the British.</span> <span m="131000">But today we are going to do divide and conquer as practiced</span> <span m="134000">in Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest and Stein or every other</span> <span m="137000">algorithm textbook. This is a very basic and very</span> <span m="140000">powerful algorithm design technique.</span> <span m="142000">So, this is our first real algorithm design experience.</span> <span m="147000">We are still sort of mostly in the analysis mode,</span> <span m="150000">but we are going to do some actual design.</span> <span m="153000">We're going to cover maybe only three or four major design</span> <span m="157000">techniques. This is one of them,</span> <span m="159000">so it is really important. And it will lead to all sorts</span> <span m="163000">of recurrences, so we will get to use</span> <span m="165000">everything from last class and see why it is useful.</span> <span m="169000">As you might expect, the first step in</span> <span m="171000">divide-and-conquer is divide and the second step is conquer.</span> <span m="177000">But you may not have guessed that there are three steps.</span> <span m="181000">And I am leaving some blank space here, so you should,</span> <span m="184000">too. Divide-and-conquer is an</span> <span m="186000">algorithmic technique. You are given some big problem</span> <span m="190000">you want to solve, you don't really know how to</span> <span m="194000">solve it in an efficient way, so you are going to split it up</span> <span m="198000">into subproblems. That is the divide.</span> <span m="202000">You are going to divide that problem, or more precisely the</span> <span m="206000">instance of that problem, the particular instance of that</span> <span m="210000">problem you have into subproblems.</span> <span m="212000">And those subproblems should be smaller in some sense.</span> <span m="216000">And smaller means normally that the value of N is smaller than</span> <span m="221000">it was in the original problem. So, you sort of made some</span> <span m="225000">progress. Now you have one,</span> <span m="227000">or more likely you have several subproblems you need to solve.</span> <span m="231000">Each of them is smaller. So, you recursively solve each</span> <span m="235000">subproblem. That is the conquer step.</span> <span m="240000">You conquer each subproblem recursively.</span> <span m="244000">And then somehow you combine those solutions into a solution</span> <span m="251000">for the whole problem.</span> <span m="263000">So, this is the general divide-and-conquer paradigm.</span> <span m="266000">And lots of algorithms fit it. You have already seen one</span> <span m="269000">algorithm that fits this paradigm, if you can remember.</span> <span m="273000">Merge sort, good. Wow, you are all awake.</span> <span m="276000">I'm impressed. So, we saw merge sort.</span> <span m="279000">And, if I am clever, I could fit it in this space.</span> <span m="282000">Sure. Let's be clever.</span> <span m="284000">A quick review on merge sort. Phrased in this 1,</span> <span m="288000">2, 3 kind of method. The first step was to divide</span> <span m="292000">your array into two halves. This really doesn't mean</span> <span m="296000">anything because you just sort of think, oh,</span> <span m="299000">I will pretend my array is divided into two halves.</span> <span m="305000">There is no work here. This is zero time.</span> <span m="307000">You just look at your array. Here is your array.</span> <span m="311000">I guess maybe you compute n/2 and take the floor.</span> <span m="314000">That takes constant time. And you say OK,</span> <span m="317000">I am pretending my array is now divided into the left part and</span> <span m="321000">the right part. And then the interesting part</span> <span m="324000">is that you recursively solve each one.</span> <span m="327000">That's the conquer. We recursively sort each</span> <span m="332000">subarray. And then the third step is to</span> <span m="337000">combine those solutions. And so here we really see what</span> <span m="344000">this means. We now have a sorted version of</span> <span m="349000">this array by induction. We have a sorted version of</span> <span m="355000">this array by induction. We now want the sorted version</span> <span m="362000">of the whole array. And we saw that was the merge</span> <span m="367000">problem, merging two sorted arrays.</span> <span m="370000">And that we saw how to do in linear time, order n time.</span> <span m="375000">I am not going to repeat that, but the point is it falls into</span> <span m="380000">that framework. I want to write the running</span> <span m="384000">time and merge sort as a recurrence.</span> <span m="389000">You have already seen the recurrence, you have already</span> <span m="393000">been told the solution, but now we actually know how to</span> <span m="397000">solve it. And, furthermore,</span> <span m="399000">every algorithm that follows the divide-and-conquer paradigm</span> <span m="403000">will have a recurrence of pretty much the same form,</span> <span m="407000">very much like our good friend the master method.</span> <span m="411000">Let's do it for merge sort where we sort of already know</span> <span m="416000">the answer and get a bit of practice.</span> <span m="420000">This is the merge sort recurrence.</span> <span m="422000">You should know and love this recurrence because it comes up</span> <span m="426000">all over the place. It comes from this general</span> <span m="429000">approach by just seeing what are the sizes of the subproblems you</span> <span m="433000">are solving and how many there are and how much extra work you</span> <span m="437000">are doing. You have here the size of the</span> <span m="440000">subproblems. It happens here that both</span> <span m="442000">subproblems have the same size roughly.</span> <span m="445000">There is this sloppiness that we have, which really should be</span> <span m="449000">T of floor of n over 2 plus T of ceiling of n over 2.</span> <span m="454000">And when you go to recitation on Friday you will see why that</span> <span m="457000">is OK, the floors and ceilings don't matter.</span> <span m="460000">There is a theorem you can prove that that's happy.</span> <span m="463000">You can assume that N is a power of 2, but we are just</span> <span m="467000">going to assume that for now. We just have two problems with</span> <span m="471000">size n over 2. This 2 is the number of</span> <span m="473000">subproblems.</span> <span m="480000">And this order n is all the extra work we are doing.</span> <span m="483000">Now, what is the extra work potentially?</span> <span m="487000">Well, the conquering is always just recursion.</span> <span m="490000">There is sort of no work there except this lead part.</span> <span m="494000">The dividing in this case is trivial, but in general it might</span> <span m="499000">involve some work. And the combining here involves</span> <span m="503000">linear work. So, this is the</span> <span m="505000">divide-and-conquer running times.</span> <span m="509000">So, this is the nonrecursive work.</span> <span m="511000">And that is generally how you convert a divide-and-conquer</span> <span m="516000">algorithm into a recurrence. It's really easy and you</span> <span m="521000">usually get to apply the master method.</span> <span m="524000">Here we are in Case 2. Very good.</span> <span m="527000">This is Case 2. And k is zero here.</span> <span m="529000">And so in the recursion tree, all of the costs are roughly</span> <span m="534000">the same. They are all n to the log base</span> <span m="538000">b of a. Here n to the log base 2 of 2</span> <span m="542000">is just n. So these are equal.</span> <span m="544000">We get an extra log factor because of the number of levels</span> <span m="547000">in the recursion tree. Remember the intuition behind</span> <span m="551000">the master method. This is n log n,</span> <span m="553000">and that is good. Merge sort is a fast sorting</span> <span m="556000">algorithm n log n. Insertion sort was n squared.</span> <span m="560000">In some sense, n log n is the best you can do.</span> <span m="563000">We will cover that in two lectures from now,</span> <span m="566000">but just foreshadowing. Today we are going to do</span> <span m="570000">different divide-and-conquer algorithms.</span> <span m="572000">Sorting is one problem. There are all sorts of problems</span> <span m="576000">we might want to solve. It turns out a lot of them you</span> <span m="579000">can apply divide-and-conquer to. Not every problem.</span> <span m="582000">Like how to wake up in the morning, it's not so easy to</span> <span m="585000">solve a divide-and-conquer, although maybe that's a good</span> <span m="588000">problem set problem.</span> <span m="599000">The next divide-and-conquer algorithm we are going to look</span> <span m="603000">at is even simpler than sorting, even simpler than merge sort,</span> <span m="609000">but it drives home the point of when you have only one</span> <span m="613000">subproblem. How many people have seen</span> <span m="616000">binary search before? Anyone hasn't?</span> <span m="619000">One, OK. I will go very quickly then.</span> <span m="622000">You have some element X. You want to find X in a sorted</span> <span m="627000">array. How many people had not seen it</span> <span m="631000">before they saw it in recitation?</span> <span m="633000">No one, OK. Good.</span> <span m="634000">You have seen it in another class, probably 6.001 or</span> <span m="638000">something. Very good.</span> <span m="639000">You took the prerequisites. OK.</span> <span m="642000">I just want to phrase it as a divide-and-conquer because you</span> <span m="646000">don't normally see it that way. The divide step is you compare</span> <span m="650000">X with the middle element in your array.</span> <span m="653000">Then the conquer step. Here is your array.</span> <span m="656000">Here is the middle element. You compare X with this thing</span> <span m="662000">if let's say X is smaller than the middle element in your</span> <span m="666000">array. You know that X is in the left</span> <span m="669000">half because it is sorted, a nice loop invariant there,</span> <span m="673000">whatever, but we are just going to think of that as recursively</span> <span m="677000">I am going to solve the problem of finding X in this subarray.</span> <span m="682000">We recurse in one subarray, unlike merge sort where we had</span> <span m="686000">two recursions. And then the combined step we</span> <span m="691000">don't do anything. I mean if you find X in here</span> <span m="695000">then you've found X in the whole array.</span> <span m="698000">There is nothing to bring it back up really.</span> <span m="702000">So, this is just phrasing binary search in the</span> <span m="706000">divide-and-conquer paradigm. It is kind of a trivial</span> <span m="711000">example, but there are lots of circumstances where you only</span> <span m="716000">need to recurse in one side. And it is important to see how</span> <span m="722000">much of a difference making one recursion versus making two</span> <span m="726000">recursions can be. This is the recurrence for</span> <span m="729000">binary search. We start with a problem size n.</span> <span m="733000">We reduce it to 1. There is an implicit 1 factor</span> <span m="736000">here. One subproblem of size n over 2</span> <span m="739000">roughly. Again, floors and ceilings</span> <span m="741000">don't matter. Plus a constant which is to</span> <span m="744000">compare X with the middle element, so it is actually like</span> <span m="748000">one comparison. This has a solution,</span> <span m="752000">log n. And you all know the running</span> <span m="755000">time of binary search, but here it is at solving the</span> <span m="758000">recurrence. I mean, there are a couple of</span> <span m="761000">differences here. We don't have the additive</span> <span m="764000">order n term. If we did, it would be linear,</span> <span m="768000">the running the time. Still better than n log n.</span> <span m="771000">So, we are getting rid of the 2, bringing it down to a 1,</span> <span m="775000">taking the n and bringing it down to a 1.</span> <span m="780000">That is making the running time a lot faster,</span> <span m="782000">the whole factor of n faster. No big surprise there.</span> <span m="785000">Let's do some more interesting algorithms.</span> <span m="798000">The powering a number problem is I give you a number X.</span> <span m="804000">I give that as like a real number or floating point number</span> <span m="811000">or whatever. And I give you an integer n,</span> <span m="815000">at least zero. I want to compute X to the</span> <span m="820000">power n. So, it's a very simple problem.</span> <span m="824000">It is, in some sense, even easier than all of these.</span> <span m="829000">But here it is. And divide-and-conquer is sort</span> <span m="834000">of the right thing to do. So, the naÔve algorithm is very</span> <span m="840000">simple. How do you compute X to the</span> <span m="844000">power n? Well, the definition of X to</span> <span m="847000">the power n is I take X and I multiply by X n times.</span> <span m="851000">So, I take X times X times X times X where there are n copies</span> <span m="856000">of X totally. And that's X to the n.</span> <span m="859000">No big surprise. That is n multiplications,</span> <span m="862000">or n minus 1 multiplications, theta n time.</span> <span m="874000">But that's not the best you can do for this problem.</span> <span m="879000">Any suggestions on what we might do using</span> <span m="884000">divide-and-conquer? Has anyone seen this algorithm</span> <span m="889000">before? A few, OK.</span> <span m="891000">For the rest? Testing on the spot creativity,</span> <span m="896000">which is very difficult, but I always like a challenge.</span> <span m="904000">I mean random ideas. What could we possibly do to</span> <span m="908000">solve this problem in less than linear time?</span> <span m="912000">How is this sort of a divide-and-conquer problem?</span> <span m="916000">We have to inputs, X and n.</span> <span m="919000">Yeah? We could try to divide on X.</span> <span m="922000">It seems a bit hard. It is just some number.</span> <span m="925000">Or, we could try to divide on n.</span> <span m="930000">Any guesses? Look at X to the n over 2,</span> <span m="932000">very good. That is exactly the idea of the</span> <span m="935000">divide-and-conquer algorithm.</span> <span m="948000">We would like to look at X to the n over 2.</span> <span m="950000">This is going to be a little bit tricky.</span> <span m="953000">Now we are going to have to pay attention to floors and</span> <span m="956000">ceilings. What I would like to say is</span> <span m="959000">while X to the n is X to the n over 2 times X to the n over 2.</span> <span m="964000">And this is true if n is even. If it is odd then I need to be</span> <span m="967000">a little bit more careful. But let's just think about the</span> <span m="971000">intuition why this is a good divide-and-conquer algorithm.</span> <span m="974000">We have a problem of size n, let's say.</span> <span m="977000">We convert it into, it looks like two subproblems</span> <span m="980000">of size n over 2, but in fact they are the same</span> <span m="983000">subproblems. So, I only have to solve one of</span> <span m="985000">them. If I compute X to the n over 2.</span> <span m="988000">Yeah, I know X to the n over 2. So, there is one conversive</span> <span m="993000">call, problem of size n over 2, then I square that number.</span> <span m="998000">And that is one computation. So, exactly the same recurrence</span> <span m="1004000">as binary search, log n time much better than n.</span> <span m="1008000">Cool. I also have to solve the odd</span> <span m="1011000">case. So, n is odd.</span> <span m="1013000">I will look at n minus 1 over</span> <span m="1016000">N minus 1 better be even. And then I am missing another</span> <span m="1022000">factor of X. If n is odd,</span> <span m="1024000">I am going to have to do one recursive call and two</span> <span m="1029000">multiplications. The same recurrence.</span> <span m="1032000">One recursive problem of size n over 2, plus constant time.</span> <span m="1037000">The dividing work here is dividing by 2 and the</span> <span m="1041000">combination work is doing one or possibly two multiplications.</span> <span m="1047000">And this is lg n. And if all you are allowed to</span> <span m="1052000">do is multiply numbers, lg n is the best you can do.</span> <span m="1057000">Good. Simple but powerful.</span> <span m="1060000">Whenever you want to compute a power of a number,</span> <span m="1064000">now you know what to do.</span> <span m="1075000">Does anyone not know the definition of Fibonacci numbers</span> <span m="1078000">and is willing to admit it? OK, so this is a good old</span> <span m="1081000">friend. I will write down the</span> <span m="1082000">definition as just a reminder. And, in particular,</span> <span m="1085000">the base cases.</span> <span m="1097000">Fibonacci numbers, I will claim,</span> <span m="1098000">are very important because it appears throughout nature.</span> <span m="1101000">You look at certain fruits, you see the Fibonacci sequence.</span> <span m="1104000">If you count the number of little bumps around each ring.</span> <span m="1108000">If you look at the sand on the beach and how the waves hit it,</span> <span m="1111000">it's the Fibonacci sequence I am told.</span> <span m="1114000">If you look all over the place, Fibonacci sequence is there.</span> <span m="1119000">How does nature compute the Fibonacci sequence?</span> <span m="1123000">Well, that is a different class.</span> <span m="1126000">But how are we going to compute the Fibonacci sequence as fast</span> <span m="1132000">as possible? You have probably seen two</span> <span m="1136000">algorithms. The most naÔve algorithm is the</span> <span m="1139000">recursive algorithm. Where you say OK,</span> <span m="1144000">f of n. I say well, if n is zero,</span> <span m="1146000">return zero, if n is 1, return one.</span> <span m="1149000">Otherwise, recursively compute f of n minus 1 and f of n minus</span> <span m="1153000">2, add them together. How much time does this</span> <span m="1157000">algorithm take, for those who have seen it</span> <span m="1160000">before? This is not obvious to guess.</span> <span m="1162000">It doesn't have to be exact.</span> <span m="1171000">OK. And how many people have seen</span> <span m="1173000">this algorithm before and analyzed it?</span> <span m="1176000">Half, OK. So what is the running time?</span> <span m="1179000">Really, really long, very good.</span> <span m="1181000">Anymore precise answers? What's that?</span> <span m="1184000">Exponential, yes.</span> <span m="1185000">That is also correct and more precise.</span> <span m="1188000">I will be even more precise. Maybe you haven't seen this</span> <span m="1192000">analysis before. It's phi to the n where phi is</span> <span m="1196000">the Golden Ratio. Again, Golden Ratio appears</span> <span m="1201000">throughout the world in mathematics.</span> <span m="1203000">This is probably the only time in this class,</span> <span m="1207000">I'm afraid, but there we go. It made its cameo so we are</span> <span m="1211000">happy. This is called exponential</span> <span m="1214000">time. This is bigger than one,</span> <span m="1216000">that's all you need to know. This is exponential time.</span> <span m="1220000">Exponential time means basically some constant to the</span> <span m="1225000">power n. Exponential time is a very long</span> <span m="1228000">time. It's bad.</span> <span m="1230000">Polynomial time is good. [LAUGHTER] This is what we</span> <span m="1235000">want, polynomial time algorithms.</span> <span m="1238000">This class is basically entirely about polynomial time</span> <span m="1242000">algorithms. Question?</span> <span m="1244000">Oh, say what the algorithm does again.</span> <span m="1247000">Define function Fibonacci of n? I check for the base cases.</span> <span m="1253000">Otherwise, I recursively call Fibonacci of n minus 1.</span> <span m="1259000">I recursively call Fibonacci of n minus 2 and add those two</span> <span m="1262000">numbers together. So, you get this branching</span> <span m="1264000">tree. You are solving two subproblems</span> <span m="1266000">of almost the same size, just additively smaller by one</span> <span m="1269000">or two. I mean you are almost not</span> <span m="1270000">reducing the problem size at all, so that's intuitively why</span> <span m="1273000">it is exponential. You can draw a recursion tree</span> <span m="1276000">and you will see how big it gets and how quickly.</span> <span m="1278000">I mean by n over two levels, you've only reduced on one</span> <span m="1281000">branch the problem from n to n over 2.</span> <span m="1283000">The other one, maybe you've gotten from n down</span> <span m="1286000">to one, but none of the branches have stopped after n of two</span> <span m="1289000">levels. You have at least 2 to the</span> <span m="1292000">power n over 2 which is like square root of 2 to the power n,</span> <span m="1297000">which is getting close to phi to the n.</span> <span m="1300000">So, this is definitely exponential.</span> <span m="1302000">And exponential is bad. We want polynomial.</span> <span m="1306000">N squared, n cubed, log n would be nice.</span> <span m="1309000">Anything that is bounded above by a polynomial is good.</span> <span m="1313000">This is an old idea. It goes back to one of the main</span> <span m="1317000">people who said polynomial is good, Jack Edmonds who is famous</span> <span m="1321000">in the combinatorial optimization world.</span> <span m="1326000">He is my academic grandfather on one side.</span> <span m="1332000">He is a very interesting guy.</span> <span m="1352000">OK, so that's a really bad algorithm.</span> <span m="1354000">You have probably seen a somewhat better algorithm,</span> <span m="1357000">which you might think of as the bottom-up implantation of that</span> <span m="1361000">recursive algorithm.</span> <span m="1369000">Or, another way to think of it is if you build out the</span> <span m="1371000">recursion tree for Fibonacci of n, you will see that there are</span> <span m="1374000">lots of common subtrees that you are just wasting time on.</span> <span m="1378000">When you solve Fibonacci of n minus 1, it again solves</span> <span m="1381000">Fibonacci of n minus 2. Why solve it twice?</span> <span m="1384000">You only need to solve it once. So, it is really easy to do</span> <span m="1387000">that if you do it bottom-up. But you could also do it</span> <span m="1391000">recursively with some cache of things you have already</span> <span m="1394000">computed. So, no big surprise.</span> <span m="1396000">You compute the Fibonacci numbers in order.</span> <span m="1399000">And each time, when you compute Fibonacci of</span> <span m="1402000">n, let's say, you have already computed the</span> <span m="1404000">previous two, you add them together,</span> <span m="1407000">it takes constant time. So, the running time here is</span> <span m="1412000">linear, linear in n, and as our input.</span> <span m="1416000">Great. Is that the best we can do?</span> <span m="1419000">No. Any ideas on how we could</span> <span m="1422000">compute Fibonacci of n faster than linear time?</span> <span m="1427000">Now we should diverge from what you have already seen,</span> <span m="1432000">most of you. Any ideas using techniques you</span> <span m="1436000">have already seen? Yes?</span> <span m="1440000">Yes. We can use the mathematical</span> <span m="1442000">trick of phi and psi to the nth powers.</span> <span m="1445000">In fact, you can just use phi, phi, pi, pho,</span> <span m="1449000">phum, whatever you want to call this Greek letter.</span> <span m="1453000">Good. Here is the mathematical trick.</span> <span m="1456000">And, indeed, this is cheating,</span> <span m="1458000">as you have said. This is no good,</span> <span m="1461000">but so it is. We will call it naÔve recursive</span> <span m="1464000">squaring and say well, we know recursive squaring.</span> <span m="1470000">Recursive squaring takes log n time.</span> <span m="1472000">Let's use recursive squaring. And if you happen to know lots</span> <span m="1476000">of properties of the Fibonacci numbers, you don't have to,</span> <span m="1480000">but here is one of them. If you take phi to the n</span> <span m="1484000">divided by root 5 and you round it to the nearest integer that</span> <span m="1488000">is the nth Fibonacci number.</span> <span m="1498000">This is pretty cool. Fibonacci of n is basically phi</span> <span m="1501000">to the n. We could apply recursive</span> <span m="1503000">squaring to compute phi to the n in log n time,</span> <span m="1507000">divide by root 5, assume that our computer has an</span> <span m="1511000">operation that rounds a number to its nearest integer and poof,</span> <span m="1516000">we are done. That doesn't work for many</span> <span m="1519000">different reasons. On a real machine,</span> <span m="1522000">probably you would represent phi and root 5 as floating point</span> <span m="1526000">numbers which have some fixed amount of precise bits.</span> <span m="1532000">And if you do this computation, you will lose some of the</span> <span m="1535000">important bits. And when you round to the</span> <span m="1537000">nearest integer you won't get the right answer.</span> <span m="1539000">So, floating point round off will kill you on a floating</span> <span m="1542000">point machine. On a theoretical machine where</span> <span m="1545000">we magically have numbers that can do crazy things like this,</span> <span m="1548000">I mean it really takes more than constant time per</span> <span m="1551000">multiplication. So, we are sort of in a</span> <span m="1553000">different model. You cannot multiply phi times</span> <span m="1556000">phi in constant time. I mean that's sort of outside</span> <span m="1558000">the boundaries of this course, but that's the way it is.</span> <span m="1563000">In fact, in a normal machine, some problems you can only</span> <span m="1566000">solve in exponential time. In a machine where you can</span> <span m="1569000">multiply real numbers and round them to the nearest integers,</span> <span m="1573000">you can solve them in polynomial time.</span> <span m="1575000">So, it really breaks the model. You can do crazy things if you</span> <span m="1579000">were allowed to do this. This is not allowed.</span> <span m="1582000">And I am foreshadowing like three classes ahead,</span> <span m="1585000">or three courses ahead, so I shouldn't talk more about</span> <span m="1588000">it. But it turns out we can use</span> <span m="1592000">recursive squaring in a different way if we use a</span> <span m="1595000">different property of Fibonacci numbers.</span> <span m="1598000">And then we will just stick with integers and everything</span> <span m="1602000">will be happy. Don't forget to go to</span> <span m="1605000">recitation and if you want to homework lab.</span> <span m="1608000">Don't come here on Monday. That is required.</span> <span m="1611000">This is sort of the right recursive squaring algorithm.</span> <span m="1617000">And this is a bit hard to guess if you haven't already seen it,</span> <span m="1622000">so I will just give it to you. I will call this a theorem.</span> <span m="1627000">It's the first time I get to use the word theorem in this</span> <span m="1632000">class. It turns out the nth Fibonacci</span> <span m="1635000">number is the nth power of this matrix.</span> <span m="1638000">Cool. If you look at it a little bit</span> <span m="1641000">you say oh, yeah, of course.</span> <span m="1644000">And we will prove this theorem in a second.</span> <span m="1649000">But once we have this theorem, we can compute f of n by</span> <span m="1651000">computing the nth power of this matrix.</span> <span m="1654000">It's a two-by-two matrix. You multiply two two-by-two</span> <span m="1656000">matrixes together, you get a two-by-two matrix.</span> <span m="1659000">So that is constant size, four numbers.</span> <span m="1661000">I can handle four numbers. We don't have crazy precision</span> <span m="1664000">problems on the floating point side.</span> <span m="1666000">There are only four numbers to deal with.</span> <span m="1668000">Matrixes aren't getting bigger. So, the running time of this</span> <span m="1672000">divide-and-conquer algorithm will still be log n because it</span> <span m="1675000">takes a constant time per two-by-two matrix</span> <span m="1677000">multiplication. Yes?</span> <span m="1680000">Oh, yes. Thank you.</span> <span m="1682000">I have a type error. Sorry about that.</span> <span m="1686000">F of n is indeed the upper left corner, I hope.</span> <span m="1692000">I better check I don't have it off by one.</span> <span m="1697000">I do. It's F_n upper right corner,</span> <span m="1701000">indeed. That's what you said.</span> <span m="1704000">F of n. I need more space.</span> <span m="1707000">Sorry. I really ought to have a</span> <span m="1712000">two-by-two matrix on the left-hand side there.</span> <span m="1716000">Thank you. So, I compute this nth power of</span> <span m="1720000">a matrix in log n time, I take the upper right corner</span> <span m="1724000">or the lower left corner, your choice,</span> <span m="1728000">that is the nth Fibonacci number.</span> <span m="1731000">This implies an order log n time algorithm with the same</span> <span m="1736000">recurrence as the last two, binary search and really the</span> <span m="1741000">recursive squaring algorithm. It is log n plus a constant,</span> <span m="1747000">so log n. Let's prove that theorem.</span> <span m="1770000">Any suggestions on what techniques we might use for</span> <span m="1774000">proving this theorem, or what technique,</span> <span m="1777000">singular? Induction, very good.</span> <span m="1780000">I think any time I ask that question the answer is</span> <span m="1784000">induction. Hint for the future in this</span> <span m="1787000">class.</span> <span m="1794000">A friend of mine, when he took an analysis class,</span> <span m="1796000">whenever the professor asked, and what is the answer to this</span> <span m="1799000">question, the answer was always zero.</span> <span m="1801000">If you have taken analysis class that is funny.</span> <span m="1804000">[LAUGHTER] Maybe I will try to ask some questions whose answers</span> <span m="1810000">are zero just for our own amusement.</span> <span m="1813000">We are going to induct on n. It's pretty much the obvious</span> <span m="1817000">thing to do. But we have to check some</span> <span m="1820000">cases. So, the base case is we have</span> <span m="1823000">this to the first power. And that is itself [(1,</span> <span m="1827000">1), (1, 0)]. And I should have said n is at</span> <span m="1833000">least 1. And you can check.</span> <span m="1836000">This is supposed to be F_2, F_1, F_1, F_0.</span> <span m="1840000">And you can check it is, F_0 is 0, F_1 is 1 and F_2 is</span> <span m="1846000">Base case is correct, step case is about as exciting,</span> <span m="1852000">but you've got to prove that your algorithm works.</span> <span m="1859000">Suppose this is what we want to compute.</span> <span m="1863000">I am just going to sort of, well, there are many ways I can</span> <span m="1870000">do this. I will just do it the fast way</span> <span m="1874000">because it's really not that exciting.</span> <span m="1878000">Which direction? Let's do this direction.</span> <span m="1883000">I want to use induction on n. If I want to use induction on</span> <span m="1889000">n, presumably I should use what I already know is true.</span> <span m="1893000">If I decrease n by 1, I have this property that this</span> <span m="1897000">thing is going to be [(1, 1), (1, 0)] to the power n</span> <span m="1900000">minus 1. This I already know,</span> <span m="1902000">by the induction hypothesis, [(1, 1), (1,</span> <span m="1905000">0)] to the n minus 1. So, presumably I should use it</span> <span m="1908000">in some way. This equality is not yet true,</span> <span m="1911000">you may have noticed. So, I need to add something on.</span> <span m="1914000">What could I possibly add on to be correct?</span> <span m="1919000">Well, another factor of [(1, 1), (1, 0)].</span> <span m="1921000">The way I am developing this proof is the only way it could</span> <span m="1925000">possibly be, in some sense. If you know its induction,</span> <span m="1928000">this is all that you could do. And then you check.</span> <span m="1932000">Indeed, this equality holds conveniently.</span> <span m="1934000">For example, F_(n plus 1) is the product of</span> <span m="1937000">these two things. It is this row times this</span> <span m="1940000">column. So, it is F_n times 1 plus F_(n</span> <span m="1942000">minus 1) times 1, which is indeed the definition</span> <span m="1945000">of F_(n plus 1). And you could check four of the</span> <span m="1950000">entries. This is true.</span> <span m="1952000">Great. If that is true then I would</span> <span m="1956000">just put these together. That is [(1,</span> <span m="1959000">1), (1, 0)] to the n minus 1 times [(1, 1),</span> <span m="1963000">(1, 0)], which is [(1, 1), (1, 0)] to the n,</span> <span m="1967000">end of proof. A very simple proof,</span> <span m="1970000">but you have to do that in order to know if this algorithm</span> <span m="1975000">really works. Good.</span> <span m="1977000">Question? Oh, yes.</span> <span m="1980000">Thank you. This, in the lower right,</span> <span m="1983000">we should have F_(n minus 1). This is why you should really</span> <span m="1988000">check your proofs. We would have discovered that</span> <span m="1992000">when I checked that this was that row times that column,</span> <span m="1996000">but that is why you are here, to fix my bugs.</span> <span m="2000000">That's the great thing about being up here instead of in a</span> <span m="2005000">quiz. But that is a minor mistake.</span> <span m="2009000">You wouldn't lose much for that.</span> <span m="2011000">All right. More divide-and-conquer</span> <span m="2014000">algorithms. Still, we have done relatively</span> <span m="2017000">simple ones so far. In fact, the fanciest has been</span> <span m="2021000">merge sort, which we already saw.</span> <span m="2024000">So, that is not too exciting. The rest have all be log n</span> <span m="2028000">time. Let's break out of the log n</span> <span m="2031000">world. Well, you all have the master</span> <span m="2034000">method memorized, right, so I can erase that.</span> <span m="2038000">Good. This will be a good test.</span> <span m="2041000">Next problem is matrix multiplication,</span> <span m="2044000">following right up on this two-by-two matrix</span> <span m="2048000">multiplication. Let's see how we can compute</span> <span m="2051000">n-by-n matrix multiplications. Just for a recap,</span> <span m="2055000">you should know how to multiply matrixes, but here is the</span> <span m="2059000">definition so we can turn it into an algorithm.</span> <span m="2062000">You have two matrixes, A and B, which are capital</span> <span m="2066000">levels. The ijth entry.</span> <span m="2068000">Ith row, jth column is called little a_ij or little b_ij.</span> <span m="2074000">And your goal is to compute the products of those matrixes.</span> <span m="2080000">I should probably say that i and j range from 1 to n.</span> <span m="2085000">So, they are square matrixes. The output is to compute C</span> <span m="2091000">which has entry c_ij which is the product of A and B.</span> <span m="2097000">And, for a recap, the ijth entry of the product</span> <span m="2101000">is the inner product of the ith row of A with the jth column of</span> <span m="2108000">B. But you can write that out as a</span> <span m="2113000">sum like so. We want to compute this thing</span> <span m="2117000">for every i and j. What is the obvious algorithm</span> <span m="2122000">for doing this? Well, for every i and j you</span> <span m="2127000">compute the sum. You compute all the products.</span> <span m="2132000">You compute the sum. So, it's like n operations here</span> <span m="2135000">roughly. I mean like 2n minus 1,</span> <span m="2137000">whatever. It is order n operations.</span> <span m="2140000">There are n^2 entries of C that I need to compute,</span> <span m="2143000">so that's n^3 time. I will write this out just for</span> <span m="2147000">the programmers at heart. Here is the pseudocode.</span> <span m="2150000">It's rare that I will write pseudocode.</span> <span m="2153000">And this is a simple enough algorithm that I can write it in</span> <span m="2157000">gory detail. But it gives you some basis for</span> <span m="2163000">this analysis if you like to program.</span> <span m="2166000">It is a triply nested for loop.</span> <span m="2177000">And I made a coding error. Hopefully you haven't written</span> <span m="2183000">that far yet. I need c_ij to be initialized</span> <span m="2187000">to zero. And then I add to c_ij the</span> <span m="2191000">appropriate product, a_ik, b_kj.</span> <span m="2196000">That is the algorithm. And the point is you have a</span> <span m="2199000">nesting of n for loops from 1 to n.</span> <span m="2202000">That takes n^3 time because this is constant and that is</span> <span m="2206000">constant. So, very simple,</span> <span m="2208000">n^3. Let's do better.</span> <span m="2217000">And, of course, we are going to use</span> <span m="2218000">divide-and-conquer.</span> <span m="2224000">Now, how are we going to divide a matrix?</span> <span m="2226000">There are a lot of numbers in a matrix, n^2 of them in each one.</span> <span m="2230000">There are all sorts of ways you could divide.</span> <span m="2232000">So far all of the divide-and-conquers we have done</span> <span m="2235000">have been problems of size n into some number of problems of</span> <span m="2239000">size n over 2. I am going to say I start with</span> <span m="2241000">some matrixes of size n-by-n. I want to convert it down to</span> <span m="2245000">something like n/2-by-n/2. Any suggestions how I might do</span> <span m="2248000">that? Yeah?</span> <span m="2250000">Block form the matrix, indeed.</span> <span m="2253000">That is the right answer. So, this is the first</span> <span m="2258000">divide-and-conquer algorithm. This will not work,</span> <span m="2263000">but it has the first idea that we need.</span> <span m="2267000">We have a n-by-n matrix. We can view it,</span> <span m="2271000">this equality is more, you can think of it as,</span> <span m="2275000">it's really the thing, a two-by-two block matrix where</span> <span m="2281000">each entry in this two-by-two block matrix is a block of</span> <span m="2286000">n/2-by-n/2 submatrixes.</span> <span m="2300000">I will think of C as being divided into three parts,</span> <span m="2307000">r, s, t and u. Even though I write them as</span> <span m="2312000">lower case letters they are really matrixes.</span> <span m="2317000">Each is n/2-by-n/2. And A, I will split into a,</span> <span m="2322000">b, c, d, times B, I will split into e,</span> <span m="2326000">f, g, h. Why not?</span> <span m="2328000">This is certainly true. And if you've seen some linear</span> <span m="2333000">algebra, this is basically what you can do with matrixes.</span> <span m="2341000">Now I can pretend these are two-by-two and sort of forget</span> <span m="2345000">the fact that these little letters are matrixes and say</span> <span m="2349000">well, r is the inner product of this row with this column.</span> <span m="2354000">It is ae times bg. Let me not cheat or else it</span> <span m="2357000">will be too easy. r=ae+bg, s=af+bh,</span> <span m="2363000">t=ce+dh and u=cf+dg. It's nothing like making it too</span> <span m="2374000">hard on yourself. OK, got them right.</span> <span m="2381000">Good. I mean this is just a fact</span> <span m="2388000">about how you would expand out this product.</span> <span m="2399000">And so now we have a recursive algorithm.</span> <span m="2401000">In fact, we have a divide-and-conquer algorithm.</span> <span m="2404000">We start with our n-by-n matrix.</span> <span m="2407000">Well, we have two of them actually.</span> <span m="2409000">We divide it into eight little pieces, a, b,</span> <span m="2412000">c, d, e, f, g, h.</span> <span m="2413000">Then we compute these things and that gives us C,</span> <span m="2416000">just by sticking them together. Now, how do we compute these</span> <span m="2420000">things? Well, these innocent-looking</span> <span m="2423000">little products between these two little numbers are actually</span> <span m="2427000">recursive matrix multiplications.</span> <span m="2431000">Because each of these little letters is an n/2-by-n/2 matrix</span> <span m="2437000">so I have to recursively compute the product.</span> <span m="2442000">There are like eight recursive multiplications of n/2-by-n/2</span> <span m="2449000">matrixes. That is what bites us.</span> <span m="2452000">And then there are like four additions, plus minor work of</span> <span m="2459000">gluing things together. How long does it take to add</span> <span m="2465000">two matrixes together? n^2.</span> <span m="2466000">This is cheap. It just takes n^2.</span> <span m="2469000">Remember, we are trying to beat n^3 for our matrix</span> <span m="2472000">multiplication. Addition is a really easy</span> <span m="2475000">problem. You just have to add every</span> <span m="2477000">number. There is no way you can do</span> <span m="2480000">better than n^2. So, that is not recursive.</span> <span m="2483000">That is the nice thing. But the bad thing is we have</span> <span m="2486000">eight of these recursions. We have</span> <span m="2491000">T(n)=8T(n/2)+Theta(n^2). And I have erased the master</span> <span m="2499000">method, but you should all have it memorized.</span> <span m="2506000">What is the solution to this recurrence?</span> <span m="2512000">Theta(n^3). That is annoying.</span> <span m="2516000">All right. A is 8, b is 2,</span> <span m="2521000">log base 2 of 8 is 3. Every computer scientist should</span> <span m="2527000">know that. n^log_b(a)=n^3.</span> <span m="2529000">That is polynomially larger than n^2, so we are in Case 1.</span> <span m="2535000">Thank you. Let's get them upside down.</span> <span m="2539000">This is n^3, no better than our previous</span> <span m="2543000">algorithm. That kind of sucks.</span> <span m="2546000">And now comes the divine inspiration.</span> <span m="2550000">Let's go over here.</span> <span m="2561000">There are some algorithms like this Fibonacci algorithm where</span> <span m="2564000">if you sat down for a little while, it's no big deal,</span> <span m="2567000">you would figure it out. I mean it is kind of clever to</span> <span m="2571000">look at that matrix and then everything works happily.</span> <span m="2574000">It is not obvious but it is not that amazingly clever.</span> <span m="2577000">This is an algorithm that is amazingly clever.</span> <span m="2581000">You may have seen it before which steals the thunder a</span> <span m="2585000">little bit, but it is still really, really cool so you</span> <span m="2590000">should be happy to see it again. And how Strassen came up with</span> <span m="2595000">this algorithm, he must have been very clever.</span> <span m="2599000">The idea is we've got to get rid of these multiplications.</span> <span m="2604000">I could do a hundred additions. That only costs Theta(n^2).</span> <span m="2610000">I have to reduce this 8 to something smaller.</span> <span m="2613000">It turns out, if you try to split the</span> <span m="2615000">matrices into three-by-three or something, that doesn't help</span> <span m="2619000">you. You get the same problem</span> <span m="2621000">because we're using fundamentally the same</span> <span m="2624000">algorithm, just in a different order.</span> <span m="2627000">We have got to somehow reduce the number of multiplications.</span> <span m="2631000">We are going to reduce it to 7. The claim is that if we have</span> <span m="2635000">two two-by-two matrices we can take their product using seven</span> <span m="2639000">multiplications. If that were true,</span> <span m="2643000">we would reduce the 8 to a 7 and presumably make things run</span> <span m="2648000">faster. We will see how fast in a</span> <span m="2651000">moment. You can compute it in your</span> <span m="2654000">head. If you are bored and like</span> <span m="2656000">computing logs that are non-integral logs then go ahead.</span> <span m="2661000">All right. Here we are.</span> <span m="2663000">This algorithm is unfortunately rather long, but it is only</span> <span m="2668000">seven multiplications.</span> <span m="2685000">Each of these P's is a product of two things which only</span> <span m="2689000">involves addition or subtraction, the same thing.</span> <span m="2738000">Those are seven multiplications.</span> <span m="2741000">And I can compute those in 7T(n/2).</span> <span m="2744000">Oh, indeed it is. Six was wrong.</span> <span m="2747000">Six and seven are the same, very good.</span> <span m="2751000">You know, you think that copying something would not be</span> <span m="2757000">such a challenging task. But when you become an</span> <span m="2762000">absent-minded professor like me then you will know how easy it</span> <span m="2767000">is. OK. We have them all correct, hopefully.</span> <span m="2770000">We continue. That wasn't enough.</span> <span m="2772000">Of course we had seven things. Clearly we have to reduce this</span> <span m="2776000">down to four things, the elements of C.</span> <span m="2779000">Here they are, the elements of C,</span> <span m="2782000">r, s, t, u. It turns out r=P_5+P_4-P_2+P_6.</span> <span m="2785000">Of course. Didn't you all see that?</span> <span m="2787000">[LAUGHTER] I mean this one is really easy,</span> <span m="2793000">s=P_1+P2. t=P_3+P_4.</span> <span m="2796000">I mean that is clearly how they were chosen.</span> <span m="2801000">And then u is another tricky one, u=P_5+P_1-P_3-P_7.</span> <span m="2808000">OK. Now, which one of these would</span> <span m="2812000">you like me to check? Don't be so nice.</span> <span m="2817000">How about s? I can show you s is right.</span> <span m="2823000">Any preferences? u.</span> <span m="2826000">Oh, no, sign errors. OK.</span> <span m="2829000">Here we go. The claim that this really</span> <span m="2834000">works is you have to check all four of them.</span> <span m="2841000">And I did in my notes. u=P_5.</span> <span m="2845000">P_5=(ae + ah + de + dh). That is P_5.</span> <span m="2851000">Check me. If I screw up,</span> <span m="2855000">I am really hosed. (af - ah) = P_1.</span> <span m="2860000">P_3 has a minus sign in front, so that is (ce + de).</span> <span m="2868000">And then we have minus P_7, which is a big one,</span> <span m="2875000">(ae + af - ce - cf). OK.</span> <span m="2880000">Now I need like the assistant that crosses off things in</span> <span m="2892000">parallel like the movie, right?</span> <span m="2899000">ah, de, af, ce, ae, thank you,</span> <span m="2905000">and hopefully these survive, dh minus minus cf.</span> <span m="2917000">And, if we are lucky, that is exactly what is written</span> <span m="2920000">here, except in the opposite order.</span> <span m="2922000">Magic, right? Where the hell did Strassen get</span> <span m="2925000">this? You have to be careful.</span> <span m="2927000">It is OK that the plus is in the wrong order because plus is</span> <span m="2931000">commutative, but the multiplications better not be in</span> <span m="2934000">the wrong order because multiplication over matrixes is</span> <span m="2938000">not commutative. I check cf, OK,</span> <span m="2941000">dh, they are in the right order.</span> <span m="2945000">I won't check the other three. That is matrix multiplication</span> <span m="2951000">in hopefully subcubic time. Let's write down the</span> <span m="2957000">recurrence. T(n) is now 7.</span> <span m="2959000">Maybe I should write down the algorithm for kicks.</span> <span m="2965000">Why not? Assuming I have time.</span> <span m="2970000">Lots of time. Last lecture I was ten minutes</span> <span m="2973000">early. I ended ten minutes early.</span> <span m="2976000">I apologize for that. I know it really upsets you.</span> <span m="2980000">And I didn't realize exactly when the class was supposed to</span> <span m="2986000">end. So, today, I get to go ten</span> <span m="2988000">minutes late. OK.</span> <span m="2990000">Good. I'm glad you all agree.</span> <span m="2992000">[LAUGHTER] I am kidding. Don't worry.</span> <span m="2995000">OK. Algorithm.</span> <span m="2996000">This is Strassen. First we divide,</span> <span m="3002000">then we conquer and then we combine.</span> <span m="3007000">As usual, I don't have it written anywhere here.</span> <span m="3014000">Fine. Divide A and B.</span> <span m="3017000">This is sort of trivial. Then we compute the terms --</span> <span m="3036000">-- for the products. This means we get ready to</span> <span m="3039000">compute all the P's. We compute a+b,</span> <span m="3042000">c+d, g-e, a+d, e+h and so on.</span> <span m="3045000">All of the terms that appear in here, we compute those.</span> <span m="3049000">That takes n2 time because it is just a bunch of additions and</span> <span m="3054000">subtractions. No big deal.</span> <span m="3056000">A constant number of them. Then we conquer by recursively</span> <span m="3064000">computing all the P_i's. That is each our product of</span> <span m="3072000">seven of them. We have P_1,</span> <span m="3077000">P_2 up to P_7. And, finally,</span> <span m="3081000">we combine, which is to compute r, s, t and u.</span> <span m="3096000">And those are just additions and subtractions again,</span> <span m="3100000">so they take n^2 times. So, here we finally get an</span> <span m="3103000">algorithm that is nontrivial both in dividing and in</span> <span m="3107000">combining. Recursion is always recursion,</span> <span m="3111000">but now we have interesting steps one and three.</span> <span m="3114000">The recurrence is T(n) is seven recursive subproblems,</span> <span m="3119000">each are size n/2 plus order n^2, to do all this addition</span> <span m="3123000">work. Now we need to solve this</span> <span m="3127000">recurrence. We compute n^log_b(a),</span> <span m="3131000">which here is nlog_2(7). And we know log base 2 of 8 is</span> <span m="3140000">little bit less than 3 but still bigger than 2 because log base 2</span> <span m="3146000">of 4 is 2. So, it is going to be</span> <span m="3150000">polynomially larger than n^2 but polynomially smaller than n^3.</span> <span m="3156000">We are again in Case 1. And this is the cheating way to</span> <span m="3161000">write n log base 2 of 7, nlg7.</span> <span m="3164000">lg means log base 2. You should know that.</span> <span m="3168000">It is all over the textbook and in our problem sets and what</span> <span m="3173000">not, nlg7. And, in particular,</span> <span m="3176000">if I have my calculator here. This is a good old-fashion</span> <span m="3182000">calculator. No, that is wrong.</span> <span m="3184000">Sorry. It is strictly less than 2.81.</span> <span m="3187000">It is strictly less than 2.81. That is cool.</span> <span m="3191000">I mean it is polynomially better than n^3.</span> <span m="3194000">Still not as good as addition, which is n^2.</span> <span m="3198000">It is generally believed, although we don't know whether</span> <span m="3203000">you can multiply as fast as you can divide for matrices.</span> <span m="3209000">We think you cannot get n^2, but who knows?</span> <span m="3212000">It could still happen. There are no lower bounds.</span> <span m="3216000">This is not the best algorithm for matrix multiplication.</span> <span m="3220000">It is sort of the simplest that beats n^3.</span> <span m="3224000">The best so far is like n^2.376.</span> <span m="3226000">Getting closer to 2. You might think these numbers</span> <span m="3230000">are a bit weird. Maybe the constants out here</span> <span m="3234000">dominate the improvement you are getting in the exponent.</span> <span m="3240000">It turns out improving the exponent is a big deal.</span> <span m="3243000">I mean, as n gets larger exponents really come out to</span> <span m="3246000">bite you. So, n^3 is pretty impractical</span> <span m="3249000">for any very large values of n. And we known that Strassen will</span> <span m="3253000">beat normal matrix multiplication if n is</span> <span m="3256000">sufficiently large. The claim is that roughly at</span> <span m="3259000">about 32 or so already you get an improvement,</span> <span m="3262000">for other reasons, not just because the exponent</span> <span m="3265000">gets better, but there you go. So, this is pretty good.</span> <span m="3270000">This is completely impractical, so don't use whatever this</span> <span m="3273000">algorithm is. I don't have the reference</span> <span m="3276000">handy, but it is just trying to get a theoretical improvement.</span> <span m="3280000">There may be others that are in between and more reasonable but</span> <span m="3284000">that is not it. Wow, lots of time.</span> <span m="3286000">Any questions? We're not done yet,</span> <span m="3289000">but any questions before we move on for matrix</span> <span m="3292000">multiplication? OK.</span> <span m="3293000">I have one more problem.</span> <span m="3315000">Divide-and-conquer is a pretty general idea.</span> <span m="3317000">I mean, you can use it to dominate countries.</span> <span m="3320000">You can use it to multiply matrices.</span> <span m="3322000">I mean, who would have thought? Here is a very different kind</span> <span m="3326000">of problem you can solve with divide-and-conquer.</span> <span m="3330000">It is not exactly an algorithmic problem,</span> <span m="3332000">although it is computer science.</span> <span m="3335000">That is clear. This is very large-scale</span> <span m="3337000">integration. The chips, they are very large</span> <span m="3340000">scale integrated. Probably even more these days,</span> <span m="3344000">but that is the catch phrase. Here is a problem,</span> <span m="3347000">and it arises in VLSI layout. We won't get into too many</span> <span m="3351000">details why, but you have some circuit.</span> <span m="3354000">And here I am going to assume that the circuit is a binary</span> <span m="3358000">tree. This is just part of a circuit.</span> <span m="3362000">Assume for now here that it is just a complete binary tree.</span> <span m="3367000">A complete binary tree looks like this.</span> <span m="3371000">In all of my teachings, I have drawn this figure for</span> <span m="3375000">sure the most. It is my favorite figure,</span> <span m="3378000">the height four complete binary tree.</span> <span m="3381000">OK, there it is. I have some tree like that as</span> <span m="3385000">some height. I want to imbed it into some</span> <span m="3390000">chip layout on a grid. Let's say it has n leaves.</span> <span m="3396000">I want to imbed it into a grid with minimum area.</span> <span m="3401000">This is a very cute problem and it really shows you another way</span> <span m="3407000">in which divide-and-conquer is a useful and powerful tool.</span> <span m="3413000">So, I have this tree. I like to draw it in this way.</span> <span m="3420000">I want to somehow draw it on the grid.</span> <span m="3422000">What that means is the vertices have to be imbedded onto dots on</span> <span m="3426000">the grid, and I am talking about the square grid.</span> <span m="3429000">It has to go to vertices of the grid.</span> <span m="3432000">And these edges have to be routed as sort of orthogonal</span> <span m="3435000">paths between one dot and another, so that should be an</span> <span m="3439000">edge and they shouldn't cross and all these good things</span> <span m="3442000">because wires do not like to cross.</span> <span m="3445000">There is the obvious way to solve this problem and there is</span> <span m="3448000">the right way.</span> <span m="3456000">And let's talk about both of them.</span> <span m="3457000">Neither of them is particularly obvious, but divide-and-conquer</span> <span m="3461000">sort of gives you a hint in the right direction.</span> <span m="3464000">So, the naÔve imbedding. I seem to like the word naÔve</span> <span m="3467000">here.</span> <span m="3474000">I am going to draw this bottom up because it is easier,</span> <span m="3478000">so leave three grid lines and then start drawing.</span> <span m="3482000">I don't know how big that is going to be.</span> <span m="3485000">Here is the bottom of our tree. This is like the little three</span> <span m="3491000">nodes there. And then I leave a blank column</span> <span m="3495000">and then a blank column. I don't actually need to leave</span> <span m="3501000">those blank columns, but it makes a prettier</span> <span m="3505000">drawing. And then we work our way up.</span> <span m="3517000">There is the tree, which should be aligned,</span> <span m="3520000">on a grid. No crossings.</span> <span m="3522000">Everything is happy. How much area does it take?</span> <span m="3525000">By area, I mean sort of the area of the bounding box.</span> <span m="3529000">So, I count this blank space even though I am not using it</span> <span m="3534000">and I count all this blank space even though I am not using it.</span> <span m="3540000">I want to look at the height. Let's call this H(n).</span> <span m="3544000">And to look at the width, which I will call W(n).</span> <span m="3548000">Now, it is probably pretty obvious that H(n) is like log n,</span> <span m="3553000">W(n) is like n or whatever. But I want to write it as a</span> <span m="3558000">recurrence because that will inspire us to do the right</span> <span m="3562000">thing. H(n).</span> <span m="3563000">Well, if you think of this as a recursion-tree,</span> <span m="3567000">in some sense. We start with the big tree.</span> <span m="3571000">We split it into two halves, two subtrees of size n/2 indeed</span> <span m="3575000">because we are counting leaves. It is exactly n/2 on each side.</span> <span m="3580000">Then for height they are in parallel so it is no big deal.</span> <span m="3583000">The height is just the height of this thing,</span> <span m="3586000">one of these subproblems plus one.</span> <span m="3588000">The width, you have to add together the two widths and also</span> <span m="3592000">add on 1. You don't have to add on 1</span> <span m="3595000">here, but it doesn't matter. It is certainly at most 1.</span> <span m="3600000">H(n) = H(n/2) + Theta(1), there you do have to add 1,</span> <span m="3610598">and W(n) = 2W(n/2) + O(1). The usual base cases.</span> <span m="3620178">I mean, these are recurrences we should know and love.</span> <span m="3632000">This is log n, I sort of have already given</span> <span m="3636155">away the answers, and this better be linear.</span> <span m="3640409">This is again Case 1. And to the log base 2 of 2 is</span> <span m="3645356">n, which is the answer, much bigger than 1.</span> <span m="3649512">And here n to the log base 2 of 1 is n to the zero,</span> <span m="3654459">which is 1, which is the same so we get log n.</span> <span m="3660000">The area is n log n, but if you are making chips you</span> <span m="3664085">want the area as small as possible so you can fit more</span> <span m="3668331">good stuff in there. So, we would like to aim for,</span> <span m="3672256">well, we certainly cannot do a better area than n.</span> <span m="3676182">You've got to put the leaves down somewhere,</span> <span m="3679627">but this is already pretty good.</span> <span m="3682110">It is only a log factor off, but we want to aim for n.</span> <span m="3686356">How could we get n? Any guesses on what needs to</span> <span m="3691053">change in this layout? Not how to do it because that</span> <span m="3694794">is not obvious, but in terms of height and</span> <span m="3697801">width what should we do? It is pretty hard to get the</span> <span m="3701616">height smaller than log n, I will tell you,</span> <span m="3704696">because this is a tree. It cannot really get its width</span> <span m="3708584">down to less than log n. What could we do to make the</span> <span m="3712398">product linear? Just random ideas.</span> <span m="3714819">What are two functions whose product is n?</span> <span m="3727000">Square root of n and square root of n.</span> <span m="3729227">That is a good choice. Were there other suggestions?</span> <span m="3732298">n times constant. Yeah, n times constant would be</span> <span m="3735188">nice. But I claim you cannot get</span> <span m="3737054">either of these down to less than a constant.</span> <span m="3739704">You could aim for n over log n by log n, that is more likely,</span> <span m="3743316">but I think that is almost impossible.</span> <span m="3745544">Root n by root n is the right answer, so let's go with that.</span> <span m="3750000">So, root n by root n. We haven't seen any recurrences</span> <span m="3756050">whose solution is root n, but surely they are out there.</span> <span m="3762450">Let's say the goal is to get W(n) = Theta(root n) and to get</span> <span m="3769316">H(n) = Theta(root n). If we did that we would be</span> <span m="3774785">happy, because then the area is the product is linear.</span> <span m="3782000">How? What is a recurrence that is in</span> <span m="3785677">the usual master method form whose solution is root n?</span> <span m="3791245">I mean, you could think of it that way.</span> <span m="3795237">Recurrence is a bit tricky, but let's just think of</span> <span m="3800490">n^log_b(a). When is log base b of a Ω?</span> <span m="3804377">Because then n^log_b(a) is root n.</span> <span m="3809000">And there is some hope that I could get a root n solution to</span> <span m="3813726">recurrence. This is designed by knowing</span> <span m="3816770">that it is divide-and-conquer, and therefore it must be</span> <span m="3821095">something like this. It is easy once you know the</span> <span m="3824940">approach you are supposed to take and you can try this</span> <span m="3829186">approach. When is log base b of a Ω?</span> <span m="3831989">Lots of solutions, shout them out.</span> <span m="3834633">4 and 2, that is a good one. I better get this right.</span> <span m="3840000">Log base 4 of 2 is Ω because the square root of 4 is 2.</span> <span m="3846410">So, let's aim for this. Why not?</span> <span m="3850089">When would we get log base 4 of 2?</span> <span m="3854007">This is b, this is a, so it should be 2T(n/4) plus</span> <span m="3859823">something. And if I want the n^log_b(a) to</span> <span m="3864690">dominate, it has got to be polynomially smaller than root</span> <span m="3871338">n. So, this should be</span> <span m="3874388">n^1/2-epsilon. But it could be smaller.</span> <span m="3877320">It could be 1. Zero would be nice,</span> <span m="3879867">but that is probably too much to hope for.</span> <span m="3883029">So, something smaller, strictly polynomially smaller</span> <span m="3886966">than root n. That is our goal.</span> <span m="3889203">And now comes the magic. If you played with this for a</span> <span m="3893293">while you would find it, I think, at this point.</span> <span m="3898000">When you know that you are somehow solve this problem of</span> <span m="3902560">size n with two subproblems of size n/4 what could you do?</span> <span m="3907287">Well, if you start thinking of things as squares,</span> <span m="3911268">this is the natural thing that happens.</span> <span m="3920000">This is called the H layout. You can imagine why.</span> <span m="3930000">It would be much easier to draw if I had a grid board,</span> <span m="3935578">a graph board, whatever, if that exists.</span> <span m="3946000">This is a recursive layout. I am only going to draw a</span> <span m="3948983">couple iterations, but hopefully you can imagine</span> <span m="3951680">the generalization.</span> <span m="3965000">I take four Hs, a good plan because I want</span> <span m="3968578">problems of size n/4. This has n/4 leaves.</span> <span m="3972156">This has n/4 leaves. This is the root,</span> <span m="3975385">by the way, in the middle. This has n/4 leaves.</span> <span m="3979400">This has n/4 leaves. So, I have four problems of</span> <span m="3983501">size n/4. Somehow I have got to get that</span> <span m="3986904">down to two. Thankfully, if I look at width</span> <span m="3991471">or if I look at height, there are only two that matter.</span> <span m="3995920">And these two matter and these two get along for free.</span> <span m="4000286">They are going in parallel, just like we had with height</span> <span m="4004818">over here. But I get that both in height</span> <span m="4008031">and in width. If I measure,</span> <span m="4010173">well, now they are equal, so I will just call them the</span> <span m="4014538">length. We have L(n)-by-L(n).</span> <span m="4018000">And if I compute well, what is L(n)?</span> <span m="4021117">I have here L(n/4) because there are only a quarter of the</span> <span m="4026194">leaves in this one or in that one, then I have a constant,</span> <span m="4031271">Theta(1), no big deal, and then I have L(n/4) again.</span> <span m="4035813">So, I get the recurrence that I wanted.</span> <span m="4046000">L(n) = 2L(n/4) + Theta(1).
