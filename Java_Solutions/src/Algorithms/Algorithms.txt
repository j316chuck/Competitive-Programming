DFS:
Conditions: Graph problem, traversals
Run Time: 100 x 100 = max usually, (can be O(n) if floodfill)
Indications: Small graph, traverse all possibilities, find all possible sequences
Other Notes: Construct graph/determine what to dfs (hard), dfs (easy), often memoize (medium), floodfill!
(You can return a value), (You can also choose to relax or not relax the recursion)

BFS:
Conditions: Graph problem, traversals
Run Time: O(N) or O(NlogN) Up to 1000 x 1000
Indications:  SHORTEST PATH!!!!! indications include same transition state costs
Other Notes: Construct graph (hardest part), put into queue (easy), traverse (medium)

Topological Sort:
Conditions: (Directed Acyclic Graph), Graph Problem, Find a linear ordering... Can make it best ordering with dfs approach...
Run Time: O(E+V)
Indications: Given a specific ordering!!! Find a linear ordering of vertices...
Other Notes: Use queue based approach ... or you can use recursive based approach.

Prim:
Conditions: Can have negative weights, Cannot be directed graph!
Run Time: O(m log n) (Slower than prim)
Indications: Minimum Cost, All components (Vertices covered)! Find the minimum spanning tree, find total cost of going from point a back to point a
Other Notes: (It is a tree) V-1 edges. Union find algorithm! can do size[f(y)]+=size[f(x)]

Kruskal:
Conditions: Can have negative weights, Cannot be directed graph!
Run Time: O(n^2) or O(mlogn) on implementation
Indications: Minimum Cost, All components (Vertices covered)! Find the minimum spanning tree, find total cost of going from point a back to point a
Other Notes: Use when you can use 2d matrix!!!

Euler's Tour:

SCC (Kosanraju): (If you have time learn Tarjan's)
Conditions: Directed graph. should be cyclic, (not bidirectional)
Run Time: O(n+m) running time x 2
Indications: Find strongly connected components, connected subgraphs, how many graphs can go from one to the other
Other Notes: comes out in topological sorting

Dijstrka:
Conditions: Can be bidirectional or directed graph, cannot have negative weights!
Run Time:
Indications:
Other Notes: O(N) O(N^2) or O(NlogN)
