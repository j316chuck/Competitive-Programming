DFS:
https://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.006/spring11/rec/rec13.pdf
undirecte graphs cannot have cross edges or forward edges
Only tree edges and back edges.

Graphs:
1. Ask what nodes and edges are?
2. What are the algorithms you need to solve given the nodes and edges?
3. What simple observation can I make to make the problem simpler?
4. Keep your eye on the task!
5. BFS and DFS are go to!!!!
6. Union find to make sure one forest or parent ... or one DFS loop ... or one task
7. Use euler's path, tarjan, articulation points sparingly
8. Max flow sparingly
9. What are the edge cases/conditions I am missing???
