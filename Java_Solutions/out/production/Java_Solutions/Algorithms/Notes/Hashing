hashCode & 0x7FFFFFFF
Math.floorMod(hashCode())
hashCode -> converts a key to a number between 0 and M-1
hashCode -> can return a negative number... must return same value for the same object that is equals
(which is why equals is so important)
collision resolution -> when keys collide = linear probing or separate chaining has table.
resizing separate hash chains = good sometimes.
performance for search, insert, get, delete = N/M = load factor
int result = 1;
final int prime = 31;
result = result * prime + (s - 'a');
hashCode automatically returns memory address
