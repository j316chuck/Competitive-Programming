Problem's Solved: 

Week's Goals: 
1. Work hard 3 hours solve 2 hours read editorials
2. Actually finish POJ Week 4 (By next week)
3. Do Contest Saturday
4. Spend 1 hour learning new ways etc/improvement

Learned:
1. Learn how to learn. Search how to do something before actually doing it. 
2. Read editorials
3. Do contests
4. Programming = use functional programming... break code down
5. learn Java and C++ (java first)
6. Focus on POJ first
7. Read hitchiker's guide and topcoder again when you come back from missions to review...
8. Redo DP during week 5
9. Do string and C++ new = power up, classes, bit twiddling, and floating tricks
10. Java also tricks... 
11. Java tests/chelper after strings

Algorithms Study: 2 days = learn how it works, runtime, and how to mutate to other problems.
Debugging Study: Reread problem !!! Come up with edge cases/bugs/missed thoughts!!!! Go over code and look for problems.
Coming up with a solution study: Functional Programming!!! Break it down into solvable parts. Tilt the program... It is doable #constraints. Pattern match into algorithms/codable parts. 
C++: Iterators very strong learn more
Java: Containers learn more (1/2 time in Java)

Schedule:
POJ until june please finish 


Must Do:
1. C++ classes, C++ STL, lambdas, pointers, input/output.
2. Java/C++ debugger CLION vs IntelliJ
3. Learn operation cost, memory cost, total runtime cost etc.

Learn a lot of algorithms

Wants:
1. Unix/Debugger
