Here are my solutions to some of the competitive programming problems I have done from online judges like USACO, Codeforces, Google Code Jam, etc. 
Most of the code was written under a contest setting or on the fly in order to learn new syntaxes and algorithms. 
I apologize for the inconsistent styles and lack of organization. 
A lot of my algorithmic implementation and most recent code is found under the C++ Solutions/Codeforces folder, the Old Solutions/USACO folder, and the C++ Solutions/Algorithms
