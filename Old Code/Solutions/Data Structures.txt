Binary Indexed Trees: 

USACO Gold January 2017:
Problem Statement: http://usaco.org/index.php?page=viewproblem2&cpid=693
Learned: Binary Indexed Trees. Solution 1. Make current tree right hand side already. 
Then subtract -1 using update for every time you iterate through. Use a map function to record which part of the array you are in
Solution 2 - (Nick Wu) Process the trees from largest to smallest. Then iterate through using a seen to count the number of trees that are larger than you you have seen. query = find lhs. seen-lhs = right.
update tree...

USACO SILVER OPEN 2012:

Learned: Binary indexed trees. 1. Do not have double = modulus 2. create ranks of each modulus using double while loop O(n) 3. sort by different values #cmp bool function
4. use sum_of_floors to keep track of all floors added. use i * current floor - sum_of_floors to get the floor of what you add. 5. Use binary indexed tree value to sum up all the modulos that occurred.
