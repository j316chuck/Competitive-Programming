MOST IMPORTANT

Routine... power of habit is most important... who are you what your character is
1. Jesus.... you need to give him 1 hour of your day... day ends at 945 no matter what ...
2. Stop thinking...
3. Work hard at whatever you are doing no wasting time #senseofurgency
4. Reside in love joy peace
5. Most important deadline: sleep at 11 - 6:30 will save you so much time and effort in the long run....
6. It's okay to not go to every service
7. Do CS 5 hours every day hard...


CS 

Project 2
1. Most important is design... first day should be all design (hardest and most important part)
play around with functions on first day!!! Write pseudocode ... good pseudocode
2. Second most important is deciding which type of variables should be used
3. How to split/reuse functions = save a lot of time
3. Third most important is writing clear and good code... 1 hour at least per function task...
4. Finally, write good test cases and edit... 1 hour at least per function task...
5. Goal is to get AC on first try!!!
Why?: Better to spend a lot of time getting design and implementation right than debugging....
