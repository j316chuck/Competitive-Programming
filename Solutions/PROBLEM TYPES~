BFS
-find the fewest number of steps (or the shortest path)
-all transitions have the same cost of 1 (sometimes it may be equal to another number)
-Often there is given a N x M table (formed of N lines and M columns) where certain cells are passable and others are impassable, and the target of the problem is to find the shortest time/path needed to reach the end point from the start one. 
Constraint-Because BFS complexity is in most cases linear (sometimes quadratic, or N logN), constraints of N (or M) could be high â€“ even up to 1 million. (1000 x 1000)

Implementation:
-In most cases, these problems will ask you to perform some step by step, straight-forward tasks. 
Constraint-Their constraints are not high, and not too low

DFS/Brute force/backtracking
-Find all possible situations
-limits are very low (50x50)

Dynamic Programming
-Usually O(n^2) and O(n^3) okay.
-Usually a transition to go from state to state.

Maximum Flow:
-Constraint = O(n^3) or O(n^4)
-should be able to create graph with edges
-have to find maximum value of something
