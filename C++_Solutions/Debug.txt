Debugging Tips:

#1 Don't Debug... Make sure you did the problem right on the 1st submission!!! Practice ACM
It's okay to do a problem with longer time or not do as many problems. Quality > Quantity!!!

#2 When Coding add assert and/or extra debug/printf statements 

#3 Reread the problem!!!! Most important step. Most of the time its cause you read the problem wrong

#4 Reread your code after, correct small mistakes.

#5 Check edge cases and initialization problems

#6 Check algorithm problems

#7 Solve.
