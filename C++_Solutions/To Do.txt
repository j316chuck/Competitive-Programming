Schedule:
From now on learn the things needed to get 6 problems on contest
1 DP 2 Graph theory 1 Segment Tree  1 Binary Search DFS 1 Free

Algorithms to learn Eventually: 
Binary Search, Set problems USACO, LCA (2 days), Hashing (2 days), Union find (1 day), Matrix rref (2 days) (not perfect but direction)

Languages:
C++ Accelerated slow and steady + Website/HTML
Future Topics:
New and delete, Memory management, boost, range (functional programming), next_permutation, 
OOP friends... Practice with BigInteger

Motto: Instead of worrying about how much you have to do
Just do it!!!
Remember its about direction not perfection 75% understanding is good enough... 
Your contests + problems will cover it!


Rule: NO more planning, only focus on today. 
Can't just keep on wasting time... so distracted (every 5 min) 
75% enough to learn more at A-star (Last plan)


Problems: 
DP-http://codeforces.com/blog/entry/337 (Bitmasks, subsets) Hamiltonian Path
Graph Theory-Heavy Light Decompositions
Strings-All algorithms, but first start with suffix arrays
Computational Geometry-Maximum triangle among n points, line line intersection problem
