Future Plans:
C++ Accelerated slow and steady + Website/HTML

Next: Math!!! (number theory review + n c K go over) (computational geometry ahhh)
Future Topics:
New and delete, Memory management, boost, range (functional programming), next_permutation, 
OOP friends... Practice with BigInteger

To Do: Math algorithms Done!!! Steady review + reading articles :D 
1) Math problems CF + POJ (10:30) POJ DONE TMW
2) GEO ALGORITHMS: 
Remember: You only need to know the algorithm 50% to solve problems!!!!
The other half = practice intution!!! Less time studying more time solving problems
3) Hacker earth (solve)
2) Lewin (understand)
4) Stanford... (final review)
1) Topcoder... = tommorow ... read + intro (3 articles max)
convex hull + line sweep + computational geometry basics

THIS IS IT!!!!

Motto: Instead of worrying about how much you have to do
Just do it!!!
Remember its about direction not perfection 75% understanding is good enough... 
Your contests + problems will cover it!


TMW: Work out examples after reading the question!
