Schedule:
New way: (focus on problem solving and learning less on debugging and coding which wastes time) Pros: more learning, Cons: Less in depth problem, less coding experience 
(especially POJ = no coding... just understanding solution, code practice POJ too :D = 10 min debug and then retry tomorrow)
Solved: Redo problems = more in depth, more coding experience by contests and specific coding times...
6 hours solve: no coding ... (think about problem) 7 problems... (one by one to get the hang of it) 45 45 45 45 ... 
1 hour coding... (3 of the hardest coding problems/hard problems) (tricky 50% + hard coding 50%);
1 hour review (doing a problem from yesterday that you marked as redo) + 15 minutes review...
2 hours contest :D 
30 min editorial (no coding) 
30 min = do more problems... 

Algorithms to learn Eventually: 
Binary Search, Set problems USACO, LCA (2 days), Hashing (2 days), Union find (1 day), Matrix rref (2 days) (not perfect but direction)

Languages:
C++ Accelerated slow and steady + Website/HTML
Future Topics:
New and delete, Memory management, boost, range (functional programming), next_permutation, 
OOP friends... Practice with BigInteger

Motto: Instead of worrying about how much you have to do
Just do it!!!
Remember its about direction not perfection 75% understanding is good enough... 
Your contests + problems will cover it!


Rule: NO more planning, only focus on today. 
Can't just keep on wasting time... so distracted (every 5 min) 
75% enough to learn more at A-star (Last plan)
