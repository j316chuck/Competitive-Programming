1. Line representation ax + by + c = 0;
2. May contain bugs*** (that's the fun part) #perfectly imperfect
3. Line from two points and line from slope
4. Project line to point (distance easy to find after that)
5. Line Line intersection (using determinant / linear algebra)
6. Same Line, Parallel Line (using dot products)
7. Perpendicular Bisector 


Correct: Line representation, perpendicular bisector, 
	paralle line, line line intersection, project line to point
Possible bugs:
	Line from two points (Copied Lewin 99% sure right)
	Line from slope (Copied Lewin 99% sure right)
	Same Line (My formula I think it's right)
	CCW (My formula I think it's right)
