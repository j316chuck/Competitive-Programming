1) :D this is cool
2) Tell if point is in a polygon (most points with polygon may involve convex hull)

***
Prerequisite: Points must be given in a certain order of input or else you have to put it into
order by using convex hull. (convex hull is counterclockwise order in your implementation)
3) If convex polygon really easy. Just do if pt[i]
4) If you don't know which orientation your polygon is you can do this implementation of poj 1548:

5) just see if the orientation/degree ever changes sign from the point. If it does then it's on outside.

6) If concave polygon or convex polygon then you can use raytracing for O(n) or unique raytracing method for O(logn)
7) Ray trace element from pt p to p, INF
8) see how many times it intersects with each edge. (if line on same line as a vertex == +2 so not edge case)
9) check if point lies on the edge, (orientation == 0) if so and OnEdge then return true, else return false.
(edge case that point lies on edge)
10) can make O(logn) implementation
