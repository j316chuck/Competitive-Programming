***** sine and cosine are in radians...
log is in base 10

Number theory/Fermat's
a^(p-1) - 1 = 1 mod p (if a and p are coprime) (Fermat's little theorem)
a^p = p mod p;
gcd(x, n) = 1; Then x and n have multiplicative inverses!
x * x^-1 = 1 mod n; -> ax + bn = 1;

CRT:
Given a, b, m, n with gcd(m, n) = 1
Find x with x ≡ a (mod m) and x ≡ b (mod n)
◮ Solution:
Let n-1 be the inverse of n modulo m
Let m-1 be the inverse of m modulo n
Set x = ann−1 + bmm−1
(check this yourself)
◮ Extension: solving for more simultaneous equations

Extended to more than one equation:

Combinatorics:
N choose K = can use brute force multiplication (watch out for overflow)
2) can use pascal's triangle = O(n^2) solution

(x+y)^n;
symmetry in counting!!!
PIE!!!!

Fibonacci sequence fast way:
F0 = 0 F1 = 1; Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2
Fn = 1/sqrt(5) (o^n - !o^n) o = (1 + sqrt(5))/2 !o = (1 - sqrt(5))/2

Any recurrence relation:
[Fn+1] = [1  1][Fn  ] = [1 s 1] ^ n [F1]
[Fn  ] = [1  0][Fn-1] = [1 0]     [F0]

//normally just use recurrence relation is enough to solve
//but if need faster can use matrix exponentiation to solve for faster cases.

Geometry Light:
vectors: (x, y)
counterclockwise rotation by angle o:
[cos o -sin o]
[sin o  cos o]

2 lines intersect: ax + by = c; dx + ey = f;
[a b][x] = [c]
[d e][y] = [f]

solution = (determinant) (ae - bd)^-1 [e  -b]
                                      [-d  a]
Edge case ae = bd then no solution if c != f else infinite solutions...

Heron's:

Can do cool extension trick to find the incenter. of sides and calculate intersection of angle bisectors

Circumcircle:

3 points determine a circle. Given a triangle A, B, C, we can easily find P
mid point -> negative slope = line. Find two lines = solve.

Power of a point:
http://mathgardenblog.blogspot.com/2013/07/power-of-a-point.html

3 points A, B, C:
2S = | B - A x C - A|
(x1, y1) x (x2, y2) = x1y2 - y1x2;


Area of Triangle or of polygon:
vertices P1, P2, ... , Pn of polygon P
P is convex or concave = can find the area by breaking it down into little triangles

Cool Theorems:
Often we have to deal with polygons whose vertices have integer coordinates. Such polygons are called lattice polygons.
B = number of lattice points on the boundary of the polygon
I = number of lattice points in the interior of the polygon
Pick's theorem: B/2 + I - 1; = area of this polygon

Euler's Formula:
V + F = E + 2, where

V = number of vertices
E = number of edges
F = number of faces

Fractions: Simplify by representing as pair, numerator denominator
Mixed Number: dividor, modulo
Complex number: simplify by representing it as real and unreal parts


Catalan Numbers:
