//bugs to check
//long long vs int
//mod when subtracting s = (((v1 - v2) % mod) + mod) % mod;
//base case missing
//continue/for loop iteration
//sort(1, n + 1) or sort(1, m + 1)
//uninitialized/wrongly initialized variables
//check if your input file "input.in" is right
//check if your expected answer is what you want
//re-read question / extra constraints
//re-check thought process


//how to solve problem
//attack vs scout
//scout = see constraints, time limit, variable etc.
//attack = find brute force way/easy for loop way to solve
//classify problem type and possible solutions
//known problem/solved before?
//binary search on answer if max or min?
//partial sums to reduce complexity
//fix a node/constraint?
//consider easier examples of the problem... 2D -> 1D
//use hashing / rng to check equalities?
//for dp = base case, state, recurrence
//what are your states you need to solve problem... define extra useful states.
//independence, one to one, simplify problem state
//hashing!!!
//bold hypothesis
//count the reverse, build solution backwards, complementary counting
//draw out the example
//look at the other states, use them as dp or states if the current state does not work
//dp = O(N^3), recursive, or LCS, or Knapsack dp...
