General Tips:
1) Seize the day, You CAN DO IT! State Champion, A+ CS61B, USACO Platinum
2) Remember your falls - USAMO, HS
3) Do harder Problems - 1 C problem maximum, 2 D's for concept, 3 E's FOCUS ON E PROBLEMS
4) Read the question carefully 3 minutes practice
5) Write solution without paper -> good notes/scratch
(I feel like your scratch work sucks more intution)
(Scratch for examples + pseudocode + jotting down ideas only)
6) You must take breaks every 2 - 3 hours. 
7) Code carefully -> minimize debugging. 
8) Editorial + Read 2 other people's solution carefully with the intent to learn something new!
