Runtime < 100 million iterations
MAX value of N                       Time complexity
   10^8                              O(N) Border case
   10^7				     O(N) Might be accepted
   10^6                              O(N) Perfect
   10^5                              O(N * logN)
   10^3                              O(N ^ 2)
   10^2                              O(N ^ 3)
   10^9                              O(logN) or Sqrt(N)
usually for loop okay. Don't do too much math or TLE

1 million sized array = 4MB of Space
1 million long long = 8MB
256 MB = 44 million max or around 
30 million array size maximum;
Usually vectors of size 1 million or 10 million are okay
and so are 2d vectors within this bound. 

Operations:


Memory:
256MB!
Usually array of size
