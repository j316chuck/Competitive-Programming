== overrided for strings, ints, vectors etc. = check normally by what you expect. 

Casting:
(short to int, int to float, double to int...)
short a = 2000;

b = int (a) //functional notation must do 

inline functions
A WORD OF WARNING: Inline functions are very good for saving time, but if you use them too often or with large functions you will have a tremendously large program. Sometimes large programs are actually less efficient, and therefore they will run more slowly than before. Inline functions are best for small functions that are called often.
